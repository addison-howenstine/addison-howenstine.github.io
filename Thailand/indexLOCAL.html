<h3>Thursday 14 May 2015: <span id="location">New Orleans, pre-departure</span></h3><br>
<p>As you probably know, this summer, I'll be traveling to Thailand! I'll be staying in
the village of Ban Nam Khem in Phang Nga, a province in the southern peninsula of Thailand.
We will be doing primarily conservation volunteering through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GVIThailandPhangNga" target="_blank">GVI</a>. 
This will entail: 
<ul> 
	<li>performing biodiversity surveys in local national parks,</li> 
	<li>helping with baby sea turtles,</li>
	<li>and teaching Burmese refugee children in schools.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Another goal of mine this summer is to learn how to build a website. The last few days, I've 
been working on getting this site up and running. It's not pretty, and it probably won't 
be pretty for a long time, but I'll learn. If you want, you can keep an eye on the blog 
to see pictures and blog posts I'll try to add on a regular basis; you can also hopefully 
watch my progress with designing the website as it becomes more than simple text and links. 
But for now, here it is. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Saturday 16 May 2015: <span id="location">On the plane between Hong Kong and Phuket</span></h3><br>
<p>It has been a very long two days of traveling, but I've enjoyed the time to sit, think, 
and read. I also wasn't expecting to find so many good movies offered for free on the planes, 
so I've been catching up on movies I haven't had time to see over the last few years. Everyone 
I've met so far has been exceptionally nice. The flight attendants between JFK airport and Vancouver 
gave us a small celebration in the back airplane cabin for Jackie's birthday (we technically never 
had May 15<sup>th</sup> because of all of the time changes).</p> 
<p>I also really enjoyed talking to Mr. Lester, the man I was sitting next to between 
Vancouver and Hong Kong. He lives in Vancouver but was visiting family in Hong Kong 
where he grew up. He couldn't believe I'd been traveling for almost 20 hours before I even 
made it to Vancouver. We've had some really long flights and layovers.</p>
<p>I've been able to read a lot of the web-design and HTML book I brought on the plane. 
The seat next to me on this plane is empty, so I've had some room to take out both my laptop 
and HTML book and practice what I've learned. It's going well so far, and I've changed my 
site from more than black and white text and added some new formatting stuff. We're almost 
to Phuket now and the landscape below is gorgeous. I wish the guy in the window seat didn't 
give me weird looks every time I scoot over and try to look out the window.</p>

<h3>Sunday 17 May 2015: <span id="location">First Day in Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>
<p>Yesterday after we landed, we met GVI volunteers at the airport and then took two vans 
back to the GVI base in Ban Nam Khem, about 1.5 hours away. Thai roads are a bit of a free 
for all, but I found the chaos of them kind of beautiful for the same reasons I find 
nature so beautiful&mdash;everyone is rushing about fending for themselves, but everything 
comes together and just works. I don't know. I think it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>When they took us to the rooms we'd be staying in, I was shocked. We all were. The view 
from our rooms is incredible. There are also stairs to the roof of the building with an even 
better view. Ban Nam Khem was hit very hard by the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, and the building 
we're staying in is a giant beautiful building built as an emergency zone, so the roof is very large and several floors 
off the ground. For us, this means you can look out at the water and the boats and the village 
and the homes. You can hear chickens clucking and crowing and motorbikes zooming down the road. 
So far, every person I've met has been extraordinarily friendly and everything I've eaten 
has been out of this world.</p>

<h3>Monday 18 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem & Navy Sea Turtle Conservation site</span></h3><br>

<p>Yesterday I spent some time wandering the village and taking out my camera for a picture 
every once in a while. The locals are so nice and so excited to smile and "wai" us (a "wai" 
is a small bow of the head and hands shown as respect for the other). There are a lot of really 
cute stray dogs and interesting chickens roaming around very different from the breeds 
we have at home. Last night we all sprawled out on the roof of the building we're in talking and 
watching for shooting stars.</p>

<p>Jack and I got up a little early this morning and went for a run around parts of Ban Nam Khem. 
As I've always argued, running is one of the best ways to explore any city. Though it was earlier 
than we'd be awake at home, the village was already alive; the fishermen had probably been 
out for hours. After our run, 
we stopped by a small market to buy some fresh fruit for breakfast. A lady was also selling 
some fried dough treat too that reminded me a lot of a beignet without powdered sugar. Don't 
tell Cafe du Monde, but I think I liked it better. And for just a couple cents for half a dozen 
better-than-beignets, yah, I'll take a few orders with a side of fresh mango.</p>

<img src="chickenFight.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"/> <!-- chickenFight.jpg -->
<img src="birdComplexes.jpg" width="60%" height="60%"/> <!-- birdComplexes.jpg -->

<p>We started the day with several training lessons on animal species we're likely to see 
on our biodiversity surveys. We had lunch at a restaurant a few minutes away where I got 
a really awesome thai noodle dish. Lunches here are all only 50 baht which is about $1.50 in 
America. Dear Sushi Love, yes, $15 for the pad thai I had delivered cost way too much.</p>

<p>After lunch, we rode the songthaew
to a beach about half an hour away to collect seaweed. We gathered several garbage bags full 
and brought it to the local Thai Navy base where there are several small pools of baby sea turtles. 
Next week, we will be helping to clean these tanks and turtles, but today we just fed and took
pictures of them. They were so cute and loved nibbling at my GoPro, which made for some awesome 
footage that I'll upload when I find strong enough wifi. I've taken a lot of great pictures and videos, 
and I'm working on getting a lot more of them on here  because I know that's what people really want, 
but for now, bear with me. I haven't had all that much time or wifi. Keep checking in for more.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 19 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3></br>

<p>Today we learned about various bird species we'll see on our biodiversity surveys and did 
other training exercises before we begin our projects tomorrow. We had an awesome lunch at 
the restaurant a few doors down again&mdash;I ordered the "chef surprise!" and it was so awesome. 
When we asked the chef what it was called, he just said it just <i>came from his brain</i>. 
He's giving us a cooking lesson tomorrow afternoon though and we were allowed to request something 
to learn from the menu. I requested whatever that meal was that came from his brain today.</p>

<img src="memorialField.jpg" class="FloatLeft" width="30%" height="30%"> <!-- memorialField.jpg -->

<p>The highlight of my day though was definitely playing soccer with some of the local children. 
There are two large fishing boats parked right in the middle of the village where they were 
dropped by the tsunami in 2004, and right beside them are some makeshift soccer goals. 
Bryce, Reddy, and I decided to go play with them this afternoon. There were about 20 boys 
ranging from probably 5- to 12 years old and they were definitely better than me. My size helped 
a bit, and after I accidentally scored the first goal, they thought I was really good&mdash;which is 
hilarious. They were so excited to high-5 me after every goal or near victory. And boy was that 
exhausting. Their energy far surpassed pirs and pretty soon we decided to go have dinner at the 
GVI base (which is always awesome).</p>

<p>We woke up really early this morning and rode another songthaew to the Turtle Center. Our job 
this morning was to scrub the turtles, apply anti-fungal ointment to any sores on them, and 
scrub their (very scummy) tanks clean. It was hard work, but we had a blast. The turtles were 
adorable but surprisingly strong. Carrying the larger turtles was tough because they would 
flap their heavy strong flippers everywhere. It was really hot outside and in the end we were 
drenched in sweat and "turtle juice", but as with any baby animal, it was totally worth it 
because they were so cute. Where else can you see a basket of turtles?</p>

<p>We also had the privilege of seeing a monitor lizard, which is a big cool lizard related 
to the Komodo Dragon (but without venom, don't worry, Mom).</p><br style="clear: both;"/>

<img src="cookingLesson.jpg" class="FloatRight" width="30%" /> <!-- cookingLesson.jpg -->

<p>Because we started the day so early, we had time to shower, have lunch, and relax before 
our afternoon plans. We spent the afternoon taking a cooking lesson from the owner of the small 
restaurant we eat at most days for only 50 baht&mdash;the equivalent of $1.50. The ingredients 
were all presented beautifully and then he showed us how to chop, prep, and cook each of our chosen dishes. 
We wrote down all of the recipes we learned, so hopefully I can get those typed up and possibly 
up here at some point. Everything he cooks is delicious. I think my favorite today might have been 
the green curry. Man the food here is great.</p><br style="clear: both;"/></p>

<h3>Thursday 21 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>

<p>Today was a more relaxed day. We started the day with a very early morning bird walk to practice 
identifying birds using field guides and binoculars. We also had a tour of Ban Nam Khem, though 
I realized I'd already explored the whole place on the three runs I'd gone on so far. It seems 
like a big town when you're walking around lost, but it really is a tiny village. I went for another run 
this afternoon and it was only 2 miles to do a full loop around&mdash;this loop takes me by the Pier and beach
where the beautiful fishing boats and ferries dock, it takes me past almost a dozen street-food vendors, it takes 
me through various neighborhoods, including the Burmese areas where the women and children  
wipe a powdery white cream on their faces (a symbol of inner beauty in Burmese culture).</p>

<img src="smallLizard.jpg" width="23%"> <!-- smallLizard.jpg -->
<img src="whiteSeaEagle.jpg" width="32%"> <!-- whiteSeaEagle.jpg -->
</center>
</br></br>

<p>I was planning to keep running a little farther when I passed by the Tsunami Memorial where 
the boys play soccer. They recognized me from our soccer game a few days ago and called out to me 
asking for me to join. I started to motion that I was busy running but quickly changed my mind. I can 
run any time. Playing soccer with these guys makes me really wish my memory was more suited to learning 
languages and remembering names. I have a hard time understanding their names, much less remembering 
two dozen of them. They couldn't pronounce my name the first time I said it so I immediately switched to 
something easier to prevent future problems. I told them "Pom chue Chuck!". <i>My name is Chuck!</i> 
The language barrier is tough, but the energy and enthusiasm is universal. I've never been a big 
sports person, but all those cliches about sports uniting cultures and stuff, well, they're true. 
I've definitely made some very real friends out there on the sandy, garbage-strewn soccer field and yet 
I can hardly understand their names. I've seen a few of the young guys walking around in the village 
and they'll always get super excited and wave as they make their ways to the school bus.</p>

<h3>Friday 22 - Sunday 24 May 2015: <span id="location">Koh Kho Khao & Banyang/Khao Lak</span></h3><br>

<img src="ferryRide.jpg" class="FloatRight" width="25%"> <!-- ferryRide.jpg -->

<p>
This weekend was a long weekend, so after we completed our Friday chores around the GVI Base, we could 
go off and explore more of Thailand. We definitely took advantage of this time to see the beautiful country 
around us. Friday afternoon we took a ferry from Ban Nam Khem across the river inlet to the island of Koh Kho Khao. 
The distance of the ferry ride felt just like crossing the Mississippi River back home to get from Algiers Point 
to the French Quarter, but the ferry itself couldn't have been more different. Their ferries are brightly 
colored wooden boats that sit very low in the water and are propelled by a relatively miniscule motor 
attached to a long metal rod that the driver can put in and out of the water to steer.
</p>
<p>
During the busy season, Koh Kho Khao is one of the quieter islands that European tourists visit 
to relax away from the busier cities in Thailand. So in off season, it was totally dead. Which was 
great. We had a massive stretch of gorgeous beach to ourselves. And best of all (in my opinion) there 
were four adorable dogs on the beach that kept me entertained. I think they were a little bored with 
the tourist season being over too.

<p>
Saturday morning we rode a songthaew to a town about an hour away called Banyang. The twelve of us 
from our group went as well as eight other volunteers from around the world also working with GVI 
currently. I've honestly had so much fun meeting and learning from the other volunteers with such 
different persepectives and backgrounds. Also they say things funny, which I really enjoy. We enjoyed 
the weekend here going to the beach, eating more delicious Thai food, and going to the Market where we 
had more food and haggled for cheap Thai clothes. I bought a (100% cheap counterfeit) Thai soccer jersey 
that I can't wait to wear the next time I play soccer with the local kids.

<h3>Monday 25 May 2015: <span id="location">Lampi National Park</span></h3><br>

<img src="lisaTheLeech.jpg" class="FloatLeft" width="30%"><br> <!-- lisaTheLeech.jpg -->

<p>
This morning we left early to do a biodiversity survey in Lampi National Park. It stormed all morning 
but miraculously wasn't while we were hiking. The rain allowed for a hike that was much cooler though: 
in temperature and in wildlife. Not only did we see tons of cool insects and lizards, but we saw a 
[something] pit viper and a flying lemur. We wrote down species identification and GPS coordinates 
for the animals we saw, and this afternoon I learned how to do the data entry with this information. 
The data will help the national parks keep tabs on species presence and locations and also helps a lot with 
government environmental policy.
</p>
<p>
Also I got a leech on my hand. I was told to leave it on until it sucked its share of blood and decided
to drop off, but after she (I named her Lisa) grew fat for over 45 minutes, I decided to pull her 
off and cut her up. I guess I can check that off my bucket list. Sorry Lisa.

<article class="BlogPost">
<h3>Thailand Happens - <span id="location">Wednesday 27 May 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>The first thing you hear from veteran volunteers and the first thing you learn for yourself first 
hand when you get here is the common adage <i>"Thailand happens!"</i>. We saw this literally the first hour 
we were here after landing&mdash;as we waited for almost an hour for the drivers who'd be taking 
us to Ban Nam Khem to finish driving around the airport and come pick us up. Then racing down 
the two lane road as our van wove around hundreds of motorcycles and motorcycle-sidecar-restaurants 
on its way to the Base. Then at dinner that night when the first meal came out an hour and a half before mine.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i>. It runs on its own time. Drivers show up when they can and dinner comes out when it's 
ready. Big or small, restaurants typically have only one or two wok stoves, so if you're going to wait 
to eat once everyone has been served, only one of you is going to have a hot meal. Don't expect me to wait though, 
we follow different rules here, and I'll eat when the food is hot. (And you know I'll clean my plate!)
</p>
<p>
It's somewhat liberating having different rules though: wake up early, get breakfast from a street vendor who'd 
never pass an inspection at home, ride in the back of a makeshift truck-bed taxi (called a songthaew); 
pick up sea turtles with your bare hands, scrub them with a toothbrush, dirty your clothes but re-wear them 
for a week; use wifi when you have it, eat dinner when it's ready, go to sleep when it's dark. 
Life in Thailand is tougher maybe, but it's simpler and it makes you tougher too. Breaking your 
rules and following new ones makes you question why you do what you do.
</p>
<p><i>
Why do we stay up so late and sleep so early wasting so many hours of daylight?<br>
Why is it so important that we all eat at the same time?<br>
Why does everyone need to drive their own big vehicle everywhere?
</i></p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i> when we're volunteering too. I think a lot of us came in with an idea of exactly 
how and when we'd be volunteering and exactly how and how much we'd be making a difference. I know I did. 
And, of course, we were wrong for thinking this. No matter how hard we try, we couldn't make a difference that 
could hold a candle to our expectations. There will always be more trash on the beach. Many of the turtles 
are still going to die. We drove out to one of the national parks we frequent yesterday and it was closed because 
of all of the rain. <i>Thailand happens.</i>
</p>
<p>
I came here expecting to be working 24/7 cleaning beaches, rehabilitating turtles, and saving the rainforest 
in my free time (as well as learning how to build a website), but that wasn't all realistic. Being here 
and doing what we can and building strong relationships with the community is so much more important 
and effective. GVI's philosophy is not to go in and fix what we think needs to be fixed but to ask the community 
how we can help. I've worked on doing this myself over the last week. My job is to do what GVI knows is best, 
based on what the community knows is best. And that's great because if they let me, I'd work myself to death. 
I need someone to remind me to step back and relax. Because <i>Thailand happens</i> and there's so much 
to love and enjoy about that.

<h3>Thursday 28 May 2015: <span id="location">First Beach Clean</span></h3><br>
<p>
This morning I worked on a beach clean inside another national park. In the two hours I was there, I must 
have picked up hundreds of lighters, hundreds of feet of string, hundreds of bottle caps and cans and SO. MUCH. 
STYROFOAM. Pardon me while I lecture for a bit, but <b>styrofoam never ever ever EVER decomposes.</b> Ever. 
I knew this before, but seeing how much of it is washed up on the beach is really sad. The string and bottle 
caps will eventually, someday a long time from now, break down a little bit, but that styrofoam will keep floating around. 
I don't like to use umbrella statements, but I'll certainly do my best to never buy things in styrofoam again.
It was a gorgeous day and gorgeous beach though. In the afternoon I observed during a lesson at a local school 
for Burmese refugee children where we teach English through conservation themed classroom lessons. Next week I'll be 
paired with a staff member to teach a lesson, and I can't wait.

<h3>Friday 29 - Sunday 31 May 2015: <span id="location">Khao Sok National Park</span></h3><br>
<p>
Sorry, this is going to be a long one. If that bothers you, just enjoy the pictures and wait for the GoPro.
This weekend was the best. Possibly ever. Friday morning we rode an hour away to Khao Sok  National Park 
and set off right away on a hike. Normally I <i>hate</i> having a guide on the trails because it makes me 
feel like a tourist and I like to think I already know all there is to know when I'm out in the forest, but 
this time I certainly didn't. We were lead by two Thai guys named Por and Porgn and not only were they as 
nice and eagerly helpful as every Thai person I've met thus far, but they really knew their stuff and I 
couldn't imagine having the same experience without them.
</p>
<center>
<img src="notObeeRiver.jpg" width="75%"> <!-- notObeeRiver.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
Our hike took us through thick rain forest trails surrounded by unknown plants and populated by 
some of the coolest insects, lizards, and [wait for it] monkeys. Tons of monkeys actually: langurs 
and macaques as well as gibbons. Por stopped often to point them out to us or to grab a pillow sized 
leaf from a vine so that he could fashion it into a Peter Pan hat to put on one of us. He often lept 
of the trail to grab at various lizards. His attempts to catch one of the flying (gliding really) 
lizards were all futile until the end when Por finally caught one, acted as if he had been bitten, 
and then made a motion to snap its neck. He showed us the belly up lizard with its outstretched wings. 
We were all shocked he'd just plucked a lizard from its natural habitat and killed it; then he laughed 
and showed us how he knew how to make the lizard play dead by blowing on its stomach. I got to hold it 
and then we tossed it into the air to fly away.
</p>
<center>
<img src="notObeeSelfie.jpg" width="65%"> <!-- notObeeSelfie.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
The forest actually reminded me so much of my summers at Camp Country Lad, which, though camp hasn't 
officially started yet, I already miss beyond compare. The trails felt like the familiar trails of my 
second home, but with very different vegetation, and the river we followed was so nearly identical 
to the Obee River I couldn't help but feel homesick for CCL. The river was gorgeous and I was so 
happy to have a few hours to swim, jump off the high rocks, and climb the waterfalls. This is my habitat too.
</p>
<p>
Our hike totaled about seven miles. We slept in the park in small jungle bungalows, and had there 
not been a bug net inside each room to wrap around the beds, I don't think the bugs would have left 
much of me to tell the tale. They weren't that bad I guess, but we're all sporting nice new bug bites. 
I didn't sleep well, but all the better to enjoy the incredible sounds of the jungle through the different 
stages of the night. There was a symphony of bird, bug, gecko, monkey, and mysterious sounds taking 
turns as the night went on.
</p>

</center>
<p>
Saturday morning we drove an hour and a half away to a boat dock where we got on a boat (just like the 
ferry we took last weekend to Koh Kho Khao) and rode another hour and a half through the most gorgeous 
lake I've ever seen (which, like at CCL, was also a river before a dam was built turning it into a lake) 
to a secluded cove where we'd be staying. On a string of docks and floating huts. I could literally (yes, 
"literally", I tried) jump from the door to our bedroom into the pure blue water. We swam for hours this 
weekend soaking in the sun and view. I've also enjoyed having a lot of time to read over the last two weeks; 
I just finished <i>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</i> by Chris Hadfield, which I had been dying to 
read for a while, and now I'm well on my way to finishing <i>A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, which 
is a much less serious but equally enjoyable read.

<p>
Our trusty guide Porgn stuck with us the whole weekend, and though we never fully understood what he was 
saying when he tried to tell us the plans for what we'd actually be doing this, he never failed to awe us 
when we got where we were going. Both on Saturday and Sunday we rode our boat to various points along the 
lake to hike out a few more miles to the entrances of some of the most spectacular caves on Earth. Let me 
drift back to my summers at camp one last time to explain that I've been on some awesome cave tours, especially 
at Cumberland Caverns where we crawled through miles of intense, winding tunnels. But what we experienced 
here was unbelievable. We trekked, slipped, and swam over an hour through one end and out the other past 
rock formations and creatures you can only find a handful of places. There were rock formations just like 
ones I've seen in commercial caves like Cumberland Caverns and Mammoth Cave, but there they are roped off 
and tourists are kept dozens of feet away—here we're encouraged to touch them. I did, and they felt harder 
and stronger than I imagined, but it still makes me suspicious and somewhat sad about what could come to these 
rarities if not preserved. On Sunday we went inside a shallower cave with a much higher ceiling. Here there were 
probably hundreds of thousands of bats hanging and flying around as well as three albino snakes, one of which was 
probably ten feet long, and some spiders the size of dinner plates.
</p>

<p>
This weekend was filled with so many new adventures. I've fallen in love with the beauty of Khao Sok National Park, 
and I know I'll be back again, hopefully again before I leave this summer, and hopefully some day in the future too. 
I got some spectacular GoPro footage this weekend, and I look forward to compiling that into a video some time soon.

Monday morning we had another incredibly productive beach clean: over a dozen filled bags of trash 
(or as most people volunteering here say, "rubbish") as well as over 300 flip flops. After that, we 
collected sea weed at another beach to bring to the Thai Navy Base Sea Turtle Center where we fed the cuties. 
Tuesday we had another successful biodiversity survey in Lampi National Park where we were able to find another 
rare pit viper to log.

<p>
Today I was on turtles. First we went to the Thai Navy Base Turtle Center where we scrubbed all of the turtles 
in the 1 month tank and the 2 months tank&mdash;which was a <i>ton</i> of turtles. We graduated the 2 months to 
the 3-4 months tank, the 1 months to the 2 months tank, and the tiny little guys to the 1 month tank. Proud moments. 
We started early in the morning and finished this by 9:00. Then we drove to another turtle center that obviously has 
less funding and resources. I don't think they were expecting us, we kind of showed up and motioned that we were here 
to help if they needed us. The one guy there who knows us motioned that he'd like us to scrub these two large concrete 
turtle tanks. 
</p>
<p>
The tile tanks at the Navy Base are easy to clean, but concrete was a different story. Those tanks took some <i>serious</i> 
scrubbing to get rid of the very thick and slippery layer of algae on all sides. That was definitely the most I've sweated 
since I've been here, and I've gone on some really hot runs through the village. I loved it. I've been trying to decide 
which activity I like best, and it's definitely working with the turtles. Not just because they're adorable and never 
fail to make me happy, but because I feel so useful working hard scrubbing tanks and shells and can see a visible difference 
that I'm making. Seeing hundreds of turtles that will survive and be released into the wild&mdash;and knowing 
I played some tiny part in that&mdash;feels amazing. Also I enjoy the hard work and sweat.

I've also been working a lot on my blog the last few days. I've learned a lot about formatting and stuff 
and I've been practicing and tweaking that. You can now see that I've got tabs [<i>woah!</i>] on the side where 
I've got About Me which is currently absolutely nothing but also a link for DONATE TO SHARK GUARDIAN!
</p>
<p>
Shark Guardian is an organization GVI Thailand works with to monitor shark populations in the area. We're 
launching a worldwide fundraiser to support local education about sharks, specifically whale sharks, and 
what must be done to save them. They say it better than I do:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<b>What is the issue, problem, or challenge?</b><br>
Recent estimates show as many as 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark products such as shark 
fin soup, teeth and shark oil are popular in much of Asia. With Shark fishing and finning largely unregulated, 
there's been a sharp decline in shark species globally. As apex predators, sharks are integral to a healthy 
marine ecosystem. Coastal Thailand relies heavily on wildlife-based tourism and fishing and the current decline 
in reef health threatens the way of life for thousands of people.

<h3>Thursday 4 June 2015: <span id="location">Community Development Center & The Base Kitchen</span></h3><br>
<img src="teaching.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatLeft"> <!-- teaching.jpg -->
<p>
Wow. What a day. What a day. For the first time since I've been here, I wasn't assigned to a strictly 
conservation project this morning (turtles, beach clean, biodiversity survey, etc.). I spent the morning 
doing a lesson plan for my very first lesson that I'd be teaching this afternoon at the local community 
center where Burmese children go to school. Thankfully, I had help from one of the staff members who 
was a total pro at it, but she worked hard to have me do as much as possible. The goal of our lessons 
is to teach intermediate English through conservation lessons, so today we were teaching about coral reefs.
</p>
<p>
I never realized how difficult it could be to teach such a seemingly simple topic; how do you explain 
to thirteen year olds with basic English that coral can look like either a rock or a plant but it is 
in fact an animal? With a lot of repetition and games. I was so nervous going into my lesson at 1:00, 
but once things got started, I think it went pretty well. It was definitely a learning process for me 
throughout the lesson, and I look forward to improving on future lessons, the kids were awesome&mdash;but 
<i>quite</i>... energetic. After the lesson, all the volunteers came down for Sports Day where we play 
all the kiddy games like Duck Duck Goose that we haven't played in ages.

<p>
When I got back from my lesson, another adventure began. On Thursday nights, we cook dinner for ourselves, 
meaning that normally about three people try their hands at cooking for 26 people. I've certainly never 
cooked for that many people before, and I don't quite remember how I got signed up for the job, but all 
of a sudden everyone was really excited we were going to be grilling on their new barbecue pit for the first time.
</p>
<p>
So Hannah and I went to the market to buy vegetables, they didn't have much and we basically just 
bought about two dozen potatoes and a  few pineapples. When we got back, the new grill was not working 
with the charcoal they had. Reddy spent more than hour slaving over the fire trying <i>everything</i> 
to get the charcoal to light, but it didn't work. Camp skills came in handy and I ended up collecting a 
ton of dry logs from behind the Base and building an actual campfire inside the pit instead. And it was hot.
</p>
<p>
We boiled potatoes and made mashed potatoes and potato salad, as well as baked potatoes (or as the 
Englishmen here call them "OMG JACKET POTATOES!!!") inside of the fire. We grilled corn, made vegetable 
kebabs with local veggies, roasted hotdog/sausages, grilled chicken legs and wings, and, best of all, 
grilled pineapple with a little bit of brown sugar. Everything came out amazing. I think we were all 
really excited to have a break from rice and Thai food; the food here is always amazing, but you do 
start to miss Western food after a little while.
</p>

<p>
We didn't stop there though. Someone bought bananas and ice cream... so I did the natural New Orleans 
boy thing, of course. We always have tons of butter and brown sugar around here, so Hannah and I went 
back outside to the kitchen and whipped up some Banana's Foster. Oh man, I needed that. The bananas 
here are a lot smaller and a lot sweeter, the brown sugar is a lot less processed (so it took much 
longer to cook down), and the butter is pretty meh, but it all cooked down in the end and came out great, 
if not exactly like it would taste at home.

<p>
The night wasn't over yet though. We had an awesome Just Dance competition inside the Base with 
videos we'd downloaded off of YouTube a few days ago. It's been an extremely long day of new things, 
but it's been a blast.

<h3>Friday 5 - Tuesday 9 June 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>

<img src="bookAndBuddha.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatRight"> <!-- bookAndBuddha.jpg -->
<p>
This weekend I opted to stay back at the GVI Base and have a relaxing time by myself and with just 
four other volunteers instead of traveling to a "paradise island" with the rest of the huge group. In the 
end, I'm really really happy with the decision&mdash;for the first time since I've been here, maybe 
for the first time in several months or years, I've had down time by myself to relax. 
</p>
<p>
On Friday I read in my hammock at the beach (next to the giant Buddha 2004 Tsunami Memorial) and 
had dinner on the beach as the sun set with the other four people who stayed. On Saturday I got my 
very first massage&mdash;Thai massages are famous for being some of the best (and cheapest) massages 
in the world. It was a lot of really intense stretching, but I felt great after. On Sunday we made 
banana pancakes and banana mango smoothies with all fresh ingredients. It's the little things. I 
also ran a whole lot on Sunday and ended up going about 11 miles.. in my Chacos. I saw some new 
parts of Ban Nam Khem and took a swim in the ocean before I headed back.

Yesterday I got to volunteer with the turtles (booyaah!). We scrubbed hundreds of turtles and one 
really big really messy tank. I also got to researching future weekend trips. If there's one thing I 
want to do before these incredible two months are over, I'd love to go Deep Water Solo climbing. I've 
enjoyed rock climbing (on indoor rock walls) for a while now, but Deep Water Solo climbing is the 
ultimate experience: you're boated out to a small rock island where you can climb as high as you 
normally would on a wall, but there's no harness and no rope&mdash;when you fall, you drop into 
the perfect blue water below. So I'm definitely looking forward to trying that hopefully. 
[<i>The picture of the rock climber is just off the internet, but hopefully I'll have one like it soon.</i>]

Last night as we were all starting to fall asleep, I heard the familiar silence of the power going out. 
All of us heard it and went outside. We ended up all going up to the roof to see the dark village and 
the stars that, for once, weren't clouded out by the.. clouds. Everyone sprawled out on the roof to watch 
the stars and shooting stars above. We were also getting a spectacular light show from the lightning in 
the clouds on the horizon. Eventually I ran downstairs and set up my camera to take long exposure 
pictures of the lightning and stars. They came out pretty amazing.

<p>
This last picture is one I pieced together of a series of pictures from the hour we were up there. As 
the Earth turns, stars (which are stationary relative to Earth) appear to rotate around in the sky. This means 
that if you take a really long picture (or stitch together a series of pictures from over an hour) the 
stars appear to streak through the sky. That's what's happening in this last picture. All the starlight 
and lightning strikes are pieced together into one picture. Other than that, there's no editing going 
on with any of these photos. It was quite a sight.

<h3>James Bond Island Tour: <span id="location">Friday 12 June 2015</span></h3><br>
<img src="monkeyPeek.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatLeft"> <!-- monkeyPeek.jpg -->
<p>
If you do a quick Google search of things to do in this area of Thailand, the first thing that comes 
up is James Bond Island. I should have guessed that this would equate to a tourist hub crawling with 
rude <i>farangs</i> (the often derogatory Thai word for <i>outsiders</i> or <i>foreigners</i>) pushing 
their ways around with cameras. This day trip was one of the two trips DukeEngage covered for us; 
the other was Khao Sok National Park which was a lot more enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
The tour began at a "Monkey Temple" which was a small cave system decked out with Buddhist shrines 
and tourist trinkets. And outside were hundreds of monkeys swarming around tourists begging for food 
like pigeons. Except more aggressively. Growing up watching movies about people with pet monkeys and 
stuff always made me want to see a monkey up close, maybe hold one, but after that experience I want 
them nowhere but the wild. Tourists have turned them into rats with thumbs. If you sat down with food, 
several dozen would literally surround you and climb all over you trying to take food from your hands. 
They jump and grab at your legs (or rather for one woman with a very tight dress, maybe your butt) as you walk by.
</p>
<br style="clear: both;"/>
<center>
<img src="feeding.gif" width="80%"> <br><br> <!-- feeding.gif -->
<img src="monkeyGrab.gif" width="80%"> <!-- monkeyGrab.gif -->
</center>
<p>
From there, we left to pile into very large motor boats made to look like the typical Thai boats 
we've ridden in, but definitely a much more commercial version that fit ten times more people. We 
sat in the front three rows where our guides named Happy and Sunny learned that we were American. 
"O-BA-MA!!" they yelled putting the emphasis on every syllable. And for the rest of the trip every 
time they saw us "O-BA-MA! O-BA-MA!".
</p>
<p>
The first place we got off was a floating village where they were circulating tourists in and out of 
to have a short lunch and split. Happy instructed us to get off the boat and take our <i>correct</i> 
wives and bags. Then he pointed to a duffel at the front next to him, "BOMB bag! Take your BOMB bags!" 
he said it like it was the funniest joke he'd told all day, but we were really confused. Language barrier? 
He got off with the bag and left it for someone. Then we saw who picked it up and our jaws dropped. The man 
sitting behind us with a long beard and turban picked it up and shuffled up the dock to lunch. Are you serious, 
Happy? Not okay..
</p>
<p>
After lunch we were ferried over to James Bond Island where <i>The Man with the Golden Gun </i> 
was filmed. I've watched the movie, and it definitely gave me unrealistic expectations of how beautiful 
and deserted the island would be. I would honestly rather be stranded on that island with the three-nippled 
evil villain and sadistic midget from the James Bond movie than the thousands of tourists all trying to take 
the same pictures of themselves pretending to hold the cave roof up or holding the giant rock jutting out of 
the ocean behind them in the palm of their hands.

<img src="catchTheWall.jpg" width="70%"> <!-- catchTheWall.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
I really don't handle tourists well. I get super stressed out by how rude and pushy they are. So I spent 
about fifteen minutes walking around the entire island taking sneaky candid photos of dozens of tourists at 
a time posing for the exact same banal photos, then I climbed around this little rock pathway around the cliff 
to a small spot away from the tourists where I could sit and finish my book. I read the last few pages of 
The Road by Cormac McCarthy up on my secret little ledge. Great book.

<p>
There was also a "kayaking" trip included.. which entailed being one of several hundred kayaks being paddled 
around some rocks, each kayak paddled by a Thai tour guid who would aggressively ask for a tip at the end. 
Eventually we got our boat ride back to shore and transport home. Overall, my rating for the James 
Bond Island Tour was <i>One out of ten would not recommend to a friend</i>, but in the end I'm really 
glad for the experience because it's made me really appreciate the beauty of the less touristy areas 
and how easily they are ruined by being over commercialized for tourists. Please nobody film a James Bond 
movie in Khao Sok National Park.

As I've mentioned, we have more than a dozen other people from around the world working with us at 
GVI, so there's a regular rotation of people. But every time someone who's been here for a while leaves, 
it's really sad. Two people went home this weekend, and goodbyes were tough. We went out for pizza in the 
nearby town of Bang Niang to have a last celebration&mdash;pizza is quite a nice treat when you have rice 
for every other meal, no matter how great the rice is. So all in all I guess you could say it was quite 
an interesting day, but we also had pizza, so it was great.
