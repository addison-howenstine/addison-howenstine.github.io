<h3>48 Hours to Reflect and Hopefully Sleep: <span id="location">Sunday July 12 2015 - Monday July 13 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>
Where do I start? What a week. I guess it's been a pretty standard week of work, but knowing it was the last made it special. I had my last visit to the Turtle Center on Wednesday; we were cleaning the tiny, adorable 15 week turtles. Thursday was our last beach clean. I didn't get to go to the forest for a survey this week though because of my legs. I'm certainly recovering quickly, but they took quite a blow and I'm trying not to overexert them (like I did when I put my 50 pound backpack on this morning to come to the airport).
</p>
<p>
I've met some incredible people here the last two months. My fellow Duke Engage students could not have been better. We grew so close to one another; last night we stayed up late giving funny superlatives to one another and digging up all our inside jokes and stories&mdash;I'm going to miss these guys. I've also made friends with some inspiring travelers and volunteers from all around the world through GVI, and hopefully I'll see some of them someday when traveling around their countries maybe. Larry in Switzerland, Jess in Belgium, and Eabha, Jessie, & Allison in Ireland, just to name a couple.
</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jyQP3cD.jpg" width="65%" title="Saying goodbye to Yoda"> <!-- tongue.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
The hardest goodbyes though have been to those I can't message on facebook and almost definitely will never see again. Foxy, Nipples, Dingo, Belle, Yoda, Michelle, and Hi-5 were a couple of the most difficult goodbyes, though they just happily wagged their tails as if it had been another ordinary visit. I haven't been able to go for any village runs lately because walking hurts enough, but I did take a nice village walk around yesterday afternoon to see all of my favorite pups and places around Ban Nam Khem. I was sad to tell our driver Thit goodbye; I'll miss his happy smile in the mornings when he picks us up to go to the Turtle Center or the National Parks. Thit was among the folks our Duke Engage group made <i>thank you</i> cards for before leaving.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YulWEd7.jpg" width="80%" title="One of our thank you cards"> <!-- thankYouCard.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
And, of course, the food. I started several days ago with ordering all of my favorite meals. Several days this week I've even gone for the two-lunch route where I'll get one lunch around 11:00 and another around 14:00. Nam, the lady who cooks at the restaurant a few houses down from us, is quite possibly my favorite person in Ban Nam Khem. She is always so happy and eager to cook for us, and her Chef's Surprise never fails to make my day. I asked her where I could find green curry powder to take home with me to cook for my family, and she went out and bough me some. She's the best. We pushed all her tables together last night for one final meal together and gave her a <i>thank you</i> card for all the happy memories and tastes. I ordered both massaman curry and green curry, and I didn't think I could put another spoon in my mouth for days after that huge meal, then she brought out a special dessert for us to say <i>goodbye</i>. It was a pumpkin and coconut milk Thai dessert, oh man I'll miss this country and it's generous people and food portions.
</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MZTLX7K.jpg" width="60%" title="Final goodbye to Foxy"> <!-- foxy.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
Now I'm enroute home. It's exactly 48 hours of travel from my home in Ban Nam Khem to my home in New Orleans. We said our last goodbyes this morning, and now the last two months that came to be so normal will be memories and photos and I'll be back in my bed before I know it. We've all done a lot of reflecting on whether and how we made an impact this summer. All this travel time certainly gives more time for thought. It's tough though. I came here wanting to save the world and thought that by now I'd feel like I accomplished a lot, but I don't know, it's tough. I've heard about this from people who've already completed DukeEngage and asked themselves the same questions. Did I make a difference?
</p>
<p>
When we showed up at the Turtle Center in a big group and scrubbed clean several tanks and hundreds of turtles, I felt like I made a difference. When we spread out on the beach to pick up a literally infinite amount of styrofoam and other trash, I felt like I made some kind of difference, even if it was small in comparison to the never-ending stretch of beach. When we went on biodiversity surveys in the forest or entered data in the afternoon, I'm not so sure. A lot of the work we did was stuff anyone could do honestly. A lot of it may have even been <i>better</i> had Thai people been doing it. I have mixed feelings about GVI and their intentions, but I think their focus, like Duke Engage's focus, was to educate us as volunteers. And part of that is learning that you can't fix everything.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fbbyReQ.jpg" width="75%" title="Sunset on my travels"> <!-- travelSunset.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
I had the time of my life this summer. I tried so many new things and new foods. I learned to speak without words and to understand a culture unlike any I've ever encountered. I've seen landscapes so magnificent, and I galloped through them. I've found myself in a small happy village no tourist could wander into, and I made it home. Someday I hope to return to Thailand. Someday I hope to find a way to continue to make a difference, but perhaps in the way I live and the job and path I choose rather than through a program like this that searches to directly fix problems we're still struggling to understand. I guess what I learned these last two months is that the best way to make the world a better place is to be a better you and to do what you can when you can to make life for those around you better too. And that's my corny finale, it's been great, Thailand. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

<h3>Fourth of July Celebration! <span id="location">Saturday 4 July 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>
As I've mentioned before, on Thursday nights someone has to volunteer to cook dinner for the group. Because all of the volunteers are splitting up to go different place this weekend, some of the Duke folks to Krabi to go climbing, some new volunteers to Khao Sok National Park, we decided to celebrate the Fourth of July on Thursday night. With so many volunteers with us from all around the world&mdash;lots from Great Britain, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, etc.&mdash;we really wanted to give them a taste of an American Fourth of July.
</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/afzsHLd.png" class="FloatLeft" width="35%" title="Our prelimanary menu for the Fourth" style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> <!-- FourthMenu.png -->
<p>
And what better way than with plenty, plenty food? Jackie and I headed up the meal, starting days in advance planning a patriotically themed menu that would put Duke's Marketplace special meal food-labels to shame. A lot of our food items were contingent on what foods we were able to find for sale throughout the village and nearby town. Also we had a budget of only 50 Baht per person. That's $1.50 per person. Try feeding your huge extended family of thirty for only $45 on the Fourth of July back home. I don't think you can. But spoiler: we stayed under budget by a few hundred Baht.
</p>
<p>
We started cooking the night before. We boiled three bags of pasta for pasta salad. Then we boiled another pot full of water, dissolved in a few cups of sugar, and then dipped in several bags of Lipton's lemon tea that we found in the pantry. What does that make? You guessed it: good old southern sweet tea. That went into the fridge to be cold for the big day.
</p>
<br style="clear: both;"/>

</center>
<p>
Thursday morning we went down to the local vegetable market to see what was available. I loaded up my backpack full of corn, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and apples and we hiked back up to the Volunteer House. We then took the Samlore (the motorcycle side cart I also rode to the local hospital last Saturday) to the local meat market. You can't do Fourth of July without burgers obviously, but there is <b>no beef in Thailand</b>. The cows here simply aren't meat cows, just milk. I had low expectations for the ground pork patties I put together. To <i>beef</i> them up a bit I mixed in 8 slices of toast crumbled into bread crumbs, two onions, and four eggs.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lOadUwE.jpg" width="80%" title="Ground pork patties and a really hot fire"> <!-- grillingPattiesSelfie.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
We concocted pasta salad and broccoli salad, we grilled corn on the cob and fried potatoes into "Freedom Fries". I had everyone help me collect firewood from along the road so I could build a nice big campfire in the barbecue pit, and once it was hot enough, I grilled the burgers. All the Duke students helped out coloring American flags on the backs of used sheets of paper left over from teaching lessons. We hung those all around the Vol House. When it was time to eat, Jackie and I set out all the food, and Bryce led everyone in the Pledge of Allegiance before dinner.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tXLvXMP.gif" width="70%" title="The board is spread"> <!-- FourthDinner.gif -->
</center>
<p>
Everyone loved it. Even I was impressed, I thought the pork burgers would be a complete flop, and maybe I was just really hungry and craving a burger, but I thought it was juicy and delicious. The salads were great. The sweet tea was cold and sweet. Everyone was really excited.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jm4YCCG.gif" width="50%" title="<i>Tarred and Feathered T-Oreos</i> aka deep fried oreos"> <!-- FourthDinner.gif -->
</center>
<p>
It didn't stop there though. For dessert we strayed a bit from the traditional Fourth of July because we don't have an oven here. But deep fried oreos are pretty American right? I mean, where else would you find that? The wok was perfect for frying. We battered them in pancake batter and dropped them into the hot oil. I thought people were going to be reluctant to try them, but once the first people ate them and loved them, everyone was eating and enjoying them. I think we all felt a little guilty that we'd actually ended up loving them as much as we did.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MKWzwxR.jpg" width="80%" title="Our second group picture of the summer"> <!-- FourthOfJulyGroupPic.jpg -->
</center>
<p> 
We finished the night with some awesome patriotic karaoke, which was extra fun with so many foreigners who didn't know any of the words. All in all, it was an incredible day. We  passed a great time and ate a ton. We didn't have all the ingredients or kitchen appliances to make a proper Fourth of July meal, but with a wok, a grill, some ingenuity, and a lot of enthusiasm and patriotism, I think we came pretty close.

<h3>Doctor Visits and Recovery &mdash; <span id="location">Wednesday 1 July 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>
In spite of my injury a week ago, or rather because of it, this week has been quite an adventure&mdash;though not the super active kind of adventure I enjoy most. My thighs have been hurting a lot from where they hit the tree, but I was worried about my knee, that could be a much worse injury. I went to the nearby hospital last Saturday to check. I was amazed by how efficient and cheap their medical service was. The inside of the hospital looked really old and outdated, but within an hour and half, I had seen several nurses, gotten two X-Rays, seen a medical doctor to discuss my X-Rays, and gotten two prescribed pain medications. All for the equivalent of about $21 (USD). Then I rode back to Ban Nam Khem with my new ace bandage. When I asked the hospital if they had crutches, they replied <i>"We no have on weekend"</i>.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NqKUutv.gif" width="65%" title="Samlore ride home from the local hospital"> <!-- Samlore.gif -->
</center>
<p>
The X-Rays didn't show anything broken, but we also wanted to be sure nothing had torn in the ligament. As active as I am, the possibility of having a permanent or reoccurring knee problem has been a really scary prospect for me this week. We got in touch with International SOS, the medical service DukeEngage goes through. They arranged another doctor's appointment for me and transportation to it in Phuket (an hour and a half away) where I could get an MRI and also see a doctor with better English. Everything went very smoothly. The MRI showed bruising on my knee bone, but nothing permanent. All of my injuries are just things that are going to hurt for a couple more weeks but will heal fine on their own.
</p>
<p>
That's great news. But it also means I can't go for any more runs while here in Thailand. Or the Deep Water Solo rock climbing trip I've been planning for this weekend for the last six weeks. I've spent a lot of time in bed recovering, but I was able to go to the Turtle Center this week to help scrub turtles. Overall, I'm very thankful for how things worked out this week and very impressed by how efficient all of the hospital visits were.

<h3>Horseback Riding & Missing CCL &mdash; <span id="location">Saturday 27 June 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>
It's been an incredible week of service. We've gone on several successful biodiversity hikes, done plenty of beach cleans, and scrubbed lots of tanks. But I can't help feeling homesick for my summer home, Camp Country Lad. This summer would be my tenth summer there, and it feels so weird for me not to be home. In a lot of ways I feel like I am there. As at camp, we lack a lot of the amenities of normal western life such as phones, air condition, and wifi&mdash;though we are actually allowed to use wifi when we can get it. Sometimes I wish we didn't have access but it is nice for things like keeping a blog and calling home. The people I've met here, both my fellow Duke volunteers and the other volunteers from around the world, are incredible. Though I do really miss my life-long camp friends.
</p>
<p>
The trails we hike for surveys remind me so much, too much, of the trails from home that I know by heart. The trails on which, any other summer, I'd be leading horseback trail rides for younger campers as I teach them to love riding and exploring nature as much as I do. So, when we passed through the next big town over, Khaolak, on the way to one of our projects early this week, I saw a sign along the road advertising <i>Khaolak Horse Club!</i>. I looked them up, saw incredible reviews, and decided to give Juu, the owner, a call. We had a hard time understanding each other between the language barrier and bad connection, but somehow we settled on him picking me up on Friday at 10:30 at the Bang Niang 7-11 store.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WxGzBOw.jpg" width="80%" title="8 summers ago with Jefferson"> <!-- jefferson.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
So early Friday morning, I began my journey. It's a two mile walk from our village to the main road where there's a bus stop for a bus that comes once every hour a little after the hour. I got there at 8:40 with plenty of time to take the 40 minute bus ride over to Bang Niang. Except the bus never came. There's a Thai holiday or celebration of some sort going on this weekend, they have one every other week it seems, so there was a school marching in a parade down the highway as I waited for the bus. And I'm 90% sure I watched the bus just drive around the paraders in front of the bus stop instead of stopping. By 9:40 I was a nervous wreck and I hailed a taxi van that had some other commuters in it, I told the driver where I was going, and he charged me the same as the bus would have so it was alright.
</p>
<p>
I made it to the 7-11 on time and met Juu, who was easy to pick out because he was wearing jeans, boots, and a plaid western-ish American Eagle shirt. He drove me up the road to his ranch where we saddled two horses: one for me and one for my guide, who doesn't speak English. That was never really a problem though, I've learned to get by just fine with hand motions. I was amazed by the great condition the horses are in. The stalls were large and clean and Juu even had a small fire by each one to keep the bugs away. Much nicer than even our barn at camp.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iHJWFCf.jpg" width="70%" title="Left to right: Juu (the owner), me, and my guide"> <!-- juu.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
Before the ride begins, Juu makes sure to know what level and experience of riding you're at. I've been on dozens of horses in my years at camp ranging from perfect horses who obey every command to horses that have never had a human on their back until me. I've never fallen off, but I've been on many bucking horses or horses that have fallen themselves. I was ready for a good ride. The ride started off from the stables and through a rubber tree plantation where the trees are planted in a tight square grid about 10 feet from one another in each direction. We walked, and then trotted, and then cantered. It was incredible. Rushing through with the trees zipping by on each side was gorgeous.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wj80aLe.jpg" width="47%" title="Sometimes I take long walks on the beach"> <!-- horseBeach.jpg -->
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KCPfCqc.jpg" width="47%" title="His name was something like <i>Moe-sah</i>"> <!-- horseAndMe.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
We made our way through plantations and fields and Thai neighborhoods and markets and more empty stretches of sandy fields until we finally made it to the beach where we let the horses cool off in the waves for a while. We walked along the beach a ways soaking in the beauty, and then we took off. So incredible. Never have I been on a horse that fast and free. Running on that beach was more than a dream come true for me. I won't get into describing it too much. I got really amazing GoPro footage of most of the trip, so please enjoy the ride with me and go ahead and watch here in my YouTube video.
</p>
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcjVpsXFpFo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
<p>
Alas, maybe the ride was too good to be true. After three hours, just as the ride was coming to a close, my guide and I were running the horses back home to the barn through the rubber plantation. He slowed his horse and turned out of the row of trees we were in and into the row parallel on the right. I tried to slow my horse so I could turn through the opening he went through, but my horse immediately whipped to the right following the motion of the horse ahead. He whipped to the right and slammed into a tree. Slammed my legs into a tree. I won't elaborate, but let's just say I'm in a lot of pain right now.
</p>
<p>
I've been riding a long time I guess. These things happen. You're taking a risk every time you get on a horse, just as you're taking a risk every time you get in a car. Honestly, I feel like deciding to ride horses yesterday was no more dangerous than being in a car on the roads here, or anywhere. There's risk in everything. Hindsight certainly makes things look different, but I'd say it was always worth the risk. The beauty and excitement I experienced on the trails and beach were unforgettable and I'm so thankful to have had the opportunity to do it. Unfortunately I didn't have the camera running during my epic George of the Jungle tree encounter. I'll be hurting for a while, but that video footage from the ride and these memories are going to last forever. And I got to cross an item off my bucket-list.

<h3>Monday 22 June 2015: <span id="location">Ton Prai National Park</span></h3><br>
<p>
This morning we went to Ton Prai National Park, which until today, I have never been to because trips to do surveys here are often rescheduled due to weather. But today, unlike any day last week, it was not storming. We hiked out to a really big waterfall and saw several bugs and amphibians along the way.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WC3UKpr.gif" width="65%" title="Ton Prai Waterfall"> <!-- waterfallSplash.gif -->
</center>
<p>
When we got to the waterfall, I went for a swim for about half an hour. After a few minutes in the water, I realized that I was being bitten by fish. The water near the waterfall was too turbulent to see the bottom, but as I got farther away, I could see that there was an entire school of fish circling my legs and nibbling at me. After five weeks here and my horrible habit of scratching my itchy feet and legs in my sleep, I have so many wounds on my lower body. And it just so happened that these fish are (probably kinda?) the same fish that they have at those spas where the fish eat away at your dead skin. They went to town on mine. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing, but they ate away my dead skin and cleaned up my wounds. I don't think the wounds could possibly get worse, so I hope it at least helped.

<article class="BlogPost">
<h3>A Normal Day in Thailand</h3><br>
<p>
So I guess my posts have been getting less frequent, both because I've been busier lately but also because things have gotten normal. [Also because I don't like working on my laptop while it's charging because if it's plugged into the 220 Volt power sources here the laptop shocks you every time you touch it.] I say that things have gotten normal in that I have settled in to a satisfying routine as I would anywhere. It's not to say there isn't a new and exciting adventure for me every day&mdash;though I have a way of finding adventure anywhere I settle in to. It's just that a normal day here has become a normal day, but I guess I haven't really explained what that is around so I'll try to explain.
</p>
<p>
Monday through Thursday I wake up at either 5:50 or 6:50 depending on what project I have that day. I pack my  backpack for the day and walk down to the Volunteer House where the rest of the volunteers live and the rest of us at least work out of. (The Duke students live in "The Foundation" several minutes down the road from the Volunteer House.) I fix myself breakfast at the Vol House, usually toast with peanut butter to fill me up, and we leave right away to go off to our project.
</p>
<p>
To get to our daily projects, we ride in the songthaews that I've mentioned before: truck beds that have been converted into a taxi cab that fits about eight or ten people. It's at least an hour ride to any of our projects, so I always bring a book. I broke my phone on the flight over to Thailand, so I haven't had that at all. I do miss it when I want to snap a quick picture of something or listen to music while on the songthaew, but it has been so relaxing not having it as a distraction. We do have wifi at the Vol House, so I can write and get work done on my laptop in my room and then go to the Vol House to upload blog posts and check social media and the news back home, which has been absolutely disgusting lately.
</p>
<p>
The three projects we typically work on are: beach cleans, self explanatory; biodiversity surveys, we keep track of species we see on hikes to the National Parks for scientific and legal purposes; and turtles, which I've talked a lot about&mdash;we scrub turtles and their tanks. We do these projects early in the mornings before it's too hot, and then we come back around noon.
</p>
<p>
<i>At which point we get lunch!</i> Lunch is always great. I get the same thing almost every day: the Chef's Surprise from Bob & Nam's restaurant. So yah, it's always different and unexpected and so so delicious. After lunch we work on a variety of things inside the Vol House. We do data entry for the species we see on the trails as well as data entry for Shark Guardian logging where which shark species are seen locally by divers. This data is extremely useful in tracking their presence as well as in getting Thailand to create laws protecting sharks.
</p>
<p>
Dinner is around 6:00 and is always incredible. A local Burmese lady named Mimi (or at least that's what we call her) cooks most nights. I have so much respect for her ability to walk in and walk out an hour later with enough food cooked for over thirty people. And it's all delicious.
</p>
<p>
We have a debrief meeting every night around 7:00 to discuss how the day went and what we'll do the next day. In the evenings we hang out a bit talking, playing games, reading and writing, and then we normally go to bed pretty early to get started with the next long day.
</p>
<p>
It's a great system. I've adjusted quite well to not doing homework late into the night. Re-learning to sleep a full eight hours also hasn't been much of a problem for me. I enjoy exploring the village, running, and trying new street foods when I can. About half of our group went off to a tourist island this weekend, but I decided to stay back in the village. Today I took the ferry to Koh Kho Khao and went on a ten mile run exploring the abandoned island. Everywhere here is so new and beautiful. The people are so friendly, the dogs are so sweet, the food, the food. It's different here in a lot of ways, but like I said, getting used to this hasn't been hard at all.

<h3>Thursday 18 June 2015</h3><br>
<p>
Well it's been quite a busy week and I really wish I had more time to write, but what can I say. Thailand happens. And it sure has been happening this week. On top of that, Duke and GVI have been assigning lots of bonus assignments and reflections for us to write which is pretty irritating for me because I'd rather spend my time blogging and journaling than writing weekly 4 page papers about other topics.. But the electricity in the whole village is out right now so I can't really work on any of those things so I'll write a blog post!
</p>
<p>
Monday morning I was in a group sent to do a biodiversity bird-walk survey on Koh Kho Khao (the nearby beautiful deserted island where I made friends with Wolf the dog). It's a gorgeous, picturesque island, but we could tell early on the weather wouldn't be quite so picturesque. Not long into our early morning, it started raining pretty hard. Luckily, I'd left my backpack back at the volunteer house, but I'd also left my raincoat. There wasn't much I could do to face the weather, so I just embraced it and got thoroughly soaked. Once you give up on staying dry, though, it really is a lot of fun.

I've had to embrace the rainy weather a lot this week. Tuesday morning on our way to our beach clean, everyone in the back of the songthaew was drenched by the time we even made it to the beach, where it continued to rain. As always, we picked up tons of trash and styrofoam.

Yesterday I was on turtle duty which, as I've mentioned, is definitely my favorite&mdash;especially on Wednesdays when we go to both of the turtle centers. At the Thai Navy Base I worked on scrubbing two tanks as well as scrubbing the large "special" turtles: turtles with a variety of deformities such as missing fins, missing eyes, and scoliosis. They're sad to see, but it's also so cool that they're even alive&mdash;because 
they certainly wouldn't be in the wild. At the second turtle center, we scrubbed two big concrete tanks. I love scrubbing these because you can really see a difference between the slick layer of algae before and the clean concrete after.

Okay wait I definitely want to mention the Chef's Surprises I've been getting at Bob & Nam's (the restaurant down the road where we have lunch). I've gotten to the point where I won't order anything but the Surprise because it's something unique every day and it's always incredible and I'm afraid to miss out. Yesterday it was this amazing curry fried rice wrapped in an omelette, today it was a neat rice and sauce dish with chicken and rice meatballs. It's always presented like a five star restaurant meal. I really wish I could take Bob & Nam home with me and have them open a restaurant on food points back at Duke.

Today we had another beach clean. When we got there, the weather was gorgeous, but I should know a calm-before-the-storm when I see one. All of a sudden, the wind rolled in whipping up a (really painful) sandstorm on the beach. It felt like, well, exactly what it was: thousands of tiny shards of sand being blown at your bare skin really really fast. The rain and wind picked up into a full force storm. I've seriously been in milder tropical storms. Driving back down the road on our way home, we were blocked by a tree that had been blown over into the road so we had to wait an hour for the National Park service to come chainsaw it out of our way. Thailand happens.

<h3>James Bond Island Tour: <span id="location">Friday 12 June 2015</span></h3><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LiwkeM4.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatLeft" title="Pure evil"> <!-- monkeyPeek.jpg -->
<p>
If you do a quick Google search of things to do in this area of Thailand, the first thing that comes up is James Bond Island. I should have guessed that this would equate to a tourist hub crawling with rude <i>farangs</i> (the often derogatory Thai word for <i>outsiders</i> or <i>foreigners</i>) pushing their ways around with cameras. This day trip was one of the two trips DukeEngage covered for us; the other was Khao Sok National Park which was a lot more enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
The tour began at a "Monkey Temple" which was a small cave system decked out with Buddhist shrines and tourist trinkets. And outside were hundreds of monkeys swarming around tourists begging for food like pigeons. Except more aggressively. Growing up watching movies about people with pet monkeys and stuff always made me want to see a monkey up close, maybe hold one, but after that experience I want them nowhere but the wild. Tourists have turned them into rats with thumbs. If you sat down with food, several dozen would literally surround you and climb all over you trying to take food from your hands. They jump and grab at your legs (or rather for one woman with a very tight dress, maybe your butt) as you walk by.
</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1ExJ0XQ.gif" width="80%" title="Mine"> <!-- monkeyGrab.gif -->
</center>
<p>
From there, we left to pile into very large motor boats made to look like the typical Thai boats we've ridden in, but definitely a much more commercial version that fit ten times more people. We sat in the front three rows where our guides named Happy and Sunny learned that we were American. "O-BA-MA!!" they yelled putting the emphasis on every syllable. And for the rest of the trip every time they saw us "O-BA-MA! O-BA-MA!".
</p>
<p>
The first place we got off was a floating village where they were circulating tourists in and out of to have a short lunch and split. Happy instructed us to get off the boat and take our <i>correct</i> wives and bags. Then he pointed to a duffel at the front next to him, "BOMB bag! Take your BOMB bags!" he said it like it was the funniest joke he'd told all day, but we were really confused. Language barrier? He got off with the bag and left it for someone. Then we saw who picked it up and our jaws dropped. The man sitting behind us with a long beard and turban picked it up and shuffled up the dock to lunch. Are you serious, Happy? Not okay..
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oJjQQoo.gif" width="50%" title="Too much sass"> <!-- sunny.gif -->
</center>
<p>
After lunch we were ferried over to James Bond Island where <i>The Man with the Golden Gun </i> was filmed. I've watched the movie, and it definitely gave me unrealistic expectations of how beautiful and deserted the island would be. I would honestly rather be stranded on that island with the three-nippled evil villain and sadistic midget from the James Bond movie than the thousands of tourists all trying to take the same pictures of themselves pretending to hold the cave roof up or holding the giant rock jutting out of the ocean behind them in the palm of their hands.

</center>
<p>
I really don't handle tourists well. I get super stressed out by how rude and pushy they are. So I spent about fifteen minutes walking around the entire island taking sneaky candid photos of dozens of tourists at a time posing for the exact same banal photos, then I climbed around this little rock pathway around the cliff to a small spot away from the tourists where I could sit and finish my book. I read the last few pages of The Road by Cormac McCarthy up on my secret little ledge. Great book.
</p>

</center>
<p>
There was also a "kayaking" trip included.. which entailed being one of several hundred kayaks being paddled around some rocks, each kayak paddled by a Thai tour guid who would aggressively ask for a tip at the end. Eventually we got our boat ride back to shore and transport home. Overall, my rating for the James Bond Island Tour was <i>One out of ten would not recommend to a friend</i>, but in the end I'm really glad for the experience because it's made me really appreciate the beauty of the less touristy areas and how easily they are ruined by being over commercialized for tourists. Please nobody film a James Bond movie in Khao Sok National Park.

As I've mentioned, we have more than a dozen other people from around the world working with us at GVI, so there's a regular rotation of people. But every time someone who's been here for a while leaves, it's really sad. Two people went home this weekend, and goodbyes were tough. We went out for pizza in the nearby town of Bang Niang to have a last celebration&mdash;pizza is quite a nice treat when you have rice for every other meal, no matter how great the rice is. So all in all I guess you could say it was quite an interesting day, but we also had pizza, so it was great.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LOiztsR.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatRight" title="Nirvana"> <!-- bookAndBuddha.jpg -->
<p>
This weekend I opted to stay back at the GVI Base and have a relaxing time by myself and with just four other volunteers instead of traveling to a "paradise island" with the rest of the huge group. In the end, I'm really really happy with the decision&mdash;for the first time since I've been here, maybe for the first time in several months or years, I've had down time by myself to relax. 
</p>
<p>
On Friday I read in my hammock at the beach (next to the giant Buddha 2004 Tsunami Memorial) and had dinner on the beach as the sun set with the other four people who stayed. On Saturday I got my very first massage&mdash;Thai massages are famous for being some of the best (and cheapest) massages in the world. It was a lot of really intense stretching, but I felt great after. On Sunday we made banana pancakes and banana mango smoothies with all fresh ingredients. It's the little things. I also ran a whole lot on Sunday and ended up going about 11 miles.. in my Chacos. I saw some new parts of Ban Nam Khem and took a swim in the ocean before I headed back.

Yesterday I got to volunteer with the turtles (booyaah!). We scrubbed hundreds of turtles and one really big really messy tank. I also got to researching future weekend trips. If there's one thing I want to do before these incredible two months are over, I'd love to go Deep Water Solo climbing. I've enjoyed rock climbing (on indoor rock walls) for a while now, but Deep Water Solo climbing is the ultimate experience: you're boated out to a small rock island where you can climb as high as you normally would on a wall, but there's no harness and no rope&mdash;when you fall, you drop into the perfect blue water below. So I'm definitely looking forward to trying that hopefully. [<i>The picture of the rock climber is just off the internet, but hopefully I'll have one like it soon.</i>]

Last night as we were all starting to fall asleep, I heard the familiar silence of the power going out. All of us heard it and went outside. We ended up all going up to the roof to see the dark village and the stars that, for once, weren't clouded out by the.. clouds. Everyone sprawled out on the roof to watch the stars and shooting stars above. We were also getting a spectacular light show from the lightning in the clouds on the horizon. Eventually I ran downstairs and set up my camera to take long exposure pictures of the lightning and stars. They came out pretty amazing.

</center>
<p>
This last picture is one I pieced together of a series of pictures from the hour we were up there. As the Earth turns, stars (which are stationary relative to Earth) appear to rotate around in the sky. This means that if you take a really long picture (or stitch together a series of pictures from over an hour) the stars appear to streak through the sky. That's what's happening in this last picture. All the starlight and lightning strikes are pieced together into one picture. Other than that, there's no editing going on with any of these photos. It was quite a sight.

<h3>Thursday 4 June 2015: <span id="location">Community Development Center & The Base Kitchen</span></h3><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hE79mNS.jpg" width="30%" class="FloatLeft" title="My first lesson"> <!-- teaching.jpg -->
<p>
Wow. What a day. What a day. For the first time since I've been here, I wasn't assigned to a strictly conservation project this morning (turtles, beach clean, biodiversity survey, etc.). I spent the morning doing a lesson plan for my very first lesson that I'd be teaching this afternoon at the local community center where Burmese children go to school. Thankfully, I had help from one of the staff members who was a total pro at it, but she worked hard to have me do as much as possible myself. The goal of our lessons is to teach intermediate English through conservation topics, so today we were teaching about coral reefs.
</p>
<p>
I never realized how difficult it could be to teach such a seemingly simple topic; how do you explain to thirteen year olds with basic English that coral can look like either a rock or a plant but is in fact an animal? With a lot of repetition and games. I was so nervous going into my lesson at 1:00, but once things got started, I think it went pretty well. It was definitely a learning process for me throughout the lesson, and I look forward to improving on future lessons, the kids were awesome&mdash;but <i>quite</i>... energetic. After the lesson, all the volunteers came down for Sports Day where we play all the kiddy games like Duck Duck Goose that we haven't played in ages.

<p>
When I got back from my lesson, another adventure began. On Thursday nights, we cook dinner for ourselves, meaning that normally about three people try their hands at cooking for 26 people. I've certainly never cooked for that many people before, and I don't quite remember how I got signed up for the job, but all of a sudden everyone was really excited we were going to be grilling on their new barbecue pit for the first time.
</p>
<p>
So Hannah and I went to the market to buy vegetables, they didn't have much and we basically just bought about two dozen potatoes and a  few pineapples. When we got back, the new grill was not working with the charcoal they had. Reddy spent more than hour slaving over the fire trying <i>everything</i> to get the charcoal to light, but it didn't work. Camp skills came in handy and I ended up collecting a ton of dry logs from behind the Base and building an actual campfire inside the pit instead. And it was hot.
</p>
<p>
We boiled potatoes and made mashed potatoes and potato salad, as well as baked potatoes (or as the Englishmen here call them "OMG JACKET POTATOES!!!") inside of the fire. We grilled corn, made vegetable kebabs with local veggies, roasted hotdog/sausages, grilled chicken legs and wings, and, best of all, grilled pineapple with a little bit of brown sugar. Everything came out amazing. I think we were all really excited to have a break from rice and Thai food; the food here is always amazing, but you do start to miss Western food after a little while.
</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/APJvt44.jpg" width="85%" title="Your cooks for the night"> <!-- cookingGroupPic.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
We didn't stop there though. Someone bought bananas and ice cream... so I did the natural New Orleans boy thing, of course. We always have tons of butter and brown sugar around here, so Hannah and I went back outside to the kitchen and whipped up some Banana's Foster. Oh man, I needed that. The bananas here are a lot smaller and a lot sweeter, the brown sugar is a lot less processed (so it took much longer to cook down), and the butter is pretty meh, but it all cooked down in the end and came out great, if not exactly like it would taste at home.

The night wasn't over yet though. We had an awesome Just Dance competition inside the Base with videos we'd downloaded off of YouTube a few days ago. It's been an extremely long day of new things, but it's been a blast.

<h3>Wednesday 3 June 2015 <span id="location"> </span></h3><br>
<p>
Monday morning we had another incredibly productive beach clean: over a dozen filled bags of trash (or as most people volunteering here say, "rubbish") as well as over 300 flip flops. After that, we collected sea weed at another beach to bring to the Thai Navy Base Sea Turtle Center where we fed the cuties. Tuesday we had another successful biodiversity survey in Lampi National Park where we were able to find another rare pit viper to log. 
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1rHfgld.jpg" width="65%" title="I say trash you say rubbish"> <!-- trashPile.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
Today I was on turtles. First we went to the Thai Navy Base Turtle Center where we scrubbed all of the turtles in the 1 month tank and the 2 months tank&mdash;which was a <i>ton</i> of turtles. We graduated the 2 months to the 3-4 months tank, the 1 months to the 2 months tank, and the tiny little guys to the 1 month tank. Proud moments. We started early in the morning and finished this by 9:00. Then we drove to another turtle center that clearly has less funding and resources. I don't think they were expecting us, we kind of showed up and motioned that we were here to help if they needed us. The one guy there who knows us motioned that he'd like us to scrub these two large concrete turtle tanks. 
</p>
<p>
The tile tanks at the Navy Base are easy to clean, but concrete was a different story. Those tanks took some <i>serious</i> scrubbing to get rid of the very thick and slippery layer of algae on all sides. That was definitely the most I've sweated since I've been here, and I've gone on some really hot runs through the village. I loved it. I've been trying to decide which activity I like best, and it's definitely working with the turtles. Not just because they're adorable and never fail to make me happy, but because I feel so useful working hard scrubbing tanks and shells and can see a visible difference that I'm making. Seeing hundreds of turtles that will survive and be released into the wild&mdash;and knowing I played some tiny part in that&mdash;feels amazing. Also I enjoy the hard work and sweat.

I've also been working a lot on my blog the last few days. I've learned a lot about formatting and stuff and I've been practicing and tweaking that. You can now see that I've got tabs [<i>woah!</i>] on the side where I've got About Me which is currently absolutely nothing but also a link for DONATE TO SHARK GUARDIAN!
</p>
<p>
Shark Guardian is an organization GVI Thailand works with to monitor shark populations in the area. We're launching a worldwide fundraiser to support local education about sharks, specifically whale sharks, and what must be done to save them. They say it better than I do:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<b>What is the issue, problem, or challenge?</b><br>
Recent estimates show as many as 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark products such as shark fin soup, teeth and shark oil are popular in much of Asia. With Shark fishing and finning largely unregulated, there's been a sharp decline in shark species globally. As apex predators, sharks are integral to a healthy marine ecosystem. Coastal Thailand relies heavily on wildlife-based tourism and fishing and the current decline 
in reef health threatens the way of life for thousands of people.

<h3>Friday 29 - Sunday 31 May 2015: <span id="location">Khao Sok National Park</span></h3><br>
<p>
Sorry, this is going to be a long one. If that bothers you, just enjoy the pictures and wait for the GoPro.This weekend was the best. Possibly ever. Friday morning we rode an hour away to Khao Sok  National Park and set off right away on a hike. Normally I <i>hate</i> having a guide on the trails because it makes me feel like a tourist and I like to think I already know all there is to know when I'm out in the forest, but this time I certainly didn't. We were led by two Thai guys named Por and Porgn and not only were they as nice and eagerly helpful as every Thai person I've met thus far, but they really knew their stuff and I couldn't imagine having the same experience without them.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bt3U2Ob.jpg" width="75%" title="Feels like CCL"> <!-- notObeeRiver.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
Our hike took us through thick rain forest trails surrounded by unknown plants and populated by some of the coolest insects, lizards, and [wait for it] monkeys. Tons of monkeys actually: langurs and macaques as well as gibbons. Por stopped often to point them out to us or to grab a pillow sized leaf from a vine so that he could fashion it into a Peter Pan hat to put on one of us. He often lept off the trail to grab at various lizards. His attempts to catch one of the flying (gliding really) lizards were all futile until the end when Por finally caught one, acted as if he had been bitten, and then made a motion to snap its neck. He showed us the belly up lizard with its outstretched wings. We were all shocked he'd just plucked a lizard from its natural habitat and killed it; then he laughed and showed us how he knew how to make the lizard play dead by blowing on its stomach. I got to hold it and then we tossed it into the air to fly&mdash;sorry, <i>glide</i>&mdash;away.
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IJYVH91.jpg" width="65%" title="Feels like CCL"> <!-- notObeeSelfie.jpg -->
</center>
<p>
The forest actually reminded me so much of my summers at Camp Country Lad, which, though camp hasn't officially started yet, I already miss beyond compare. The trails felt like the familiar trails of my second home, but with very different vegetation, and the river we followed was so nearly identical to the Obee River I couldn't help but feel homesick for CCL. The river was gorgeous and I was so happy to have a few hours to swim, jump off the high rocks, and climb the waterfalls. This is my habitat too.
</p>
<p>
Our hike totaled about seven miles. We slept in the park in small jungle bungalows, and had there not been a bug net inside each room to wrap around the beds, I don't think the bugs would have left much of me to tell the tale. They weren't that bad I guess, but we're all sporting nice new bug bites. I didn't sleep well, but all the better to enjoy the incredible sounds of the jungle through the different stages of the night. There was a symphony of bird, bug, gecko, monkey, and mysterious sounds taking 
turns as the night went on.

</center>
<p>
Saturday morning we drove an hour and a half away to a boat dock where we got on a boat (just like the ferry we took last weekend to Koh Kho Khao) and rode another hour and a half through the most gorgeous lake I've ever seen (which, like at CCL, was also a river before a dam was built turning it into a lake) to a secluded cove where we'd be staying. On a string of docks and floating huts. I could literally (yes, "literally", I tried) jump from the door to our bedroom into the pure blue water. We swam for hours this weekend soaking in the sun and view. I've also enjoyed having a lot of time to read over the last two weeks; I just finished <i>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</i> by Chris Hadfield, which I had been dying to read for a while, and now I'm well on my way to finishing <i>A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, which is a much less serious but equally enjoyable read.

<p>
Our trusty guide Porgn stuck with us the whole weekend, and though we never fully understood what he was saying when he tried to tell us the plans for what we'd actually be doing, he never failed to awe us when we got where we were going. Both on Saturday and Sunday we rode our boat to various points along the lake to hike out a few more miles to the entrances of some of the most spectacular caves on Earth. Let me drift back to my summers at camp one last time to explain that I've been on some awesome cave tours, especially at Cumberland Caverns where we crawled through miles of intense, winding tunnels. But what we experienced here was unbelievable. We trekked, slipped, and swam over an hour through one end and out the other past rock formations and creatures you can only find a handful of places. There were rock formations just like ones I've seen in commercial caves like Cumberland Caverns and Mammoth Cave, but there they are roped off and tourists are kept dozens of feet away&mdash;here we're encouraged to touch them. I did, and they felt harder and stronger than I imagined, but it still makes me suspicious and somewhat sad about what could come to these rarities if not preserved. On Sunday we went inside a shallower cave with a much higher ceiling. Here there were probably hundreds of thousands of bats hanging and flying around as well as three albino snakes, one of which was probably ten feet long, and some spiders the size of dinner plates.

This weekend was filled with so many new adventures. I've fallen in love with the beauty of Khao Sok National Park, and I know I'll be back again, hopefully again before I leave this summer, and hopefully some day in the future too. I got some spectacular GoPro footage this weekend, and I look forward to compiling that into a video some time soon.

<h3>Thailand Happens - <span id="location">Wednesday 27 May 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>The first thing you hear from veteran volunteers and the first thing you learn for yourself first hand when you get here is the common adage <i>"Thailand happens!"</i>. We saw this literally the first hour we were here after landing&mdash;as we waited almost an hour for the drivers who'd be taking us to Ban Nam Khem to finish driving around the airport and come pick us up. Then racing down the two lane road as our van wove around hundreds of motorcycles and motorcycle-sidecar-restaurants on its way to the Base. Then at dinner that night when the first meal came out an hour and a half before mine.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i>. It runs on its own time. Drivers show up when they can and dinner comes out when it's ready. Big or small, restaurants typically have only one or two wok stoves, so if you're going to wait to eat once everyone has been served, only one or two of you is going to have a hot meal. Don't expect me to wait though, we follow different rules here, and I'll eat when the food is hot. (And you know I'll clean my plate!)
</p>
<p>
It's somewhat liberating having different rules though: wake up early, get breakfast from a street vendor who'd never pass an inspection at home, ride in the back of a makeshift truck-bed taxi (called a songthaew); pick up sea turtles with your bare hands, scrub them with a toothbrush, dirty your clothes but re-wear them for a week; use wifi when you have it, eat dinner when it's ready, go to sleep when it's dark. Life in Thailand is tougher maybe, but it's simpler and it makes you tougher too. Breaking your rules and following new ones makes you question why you do what you do.
</p>
<p><i>
Why do we stay up so late and sleep so early wasting so many hours of daylight?<br>
Why is it so important that we all eat at the same time?<br>
Why does everyone need to drive their own big vehicle everywhere?
</i></p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i> when we're volunteering too. I think a lot of us came in with an idea of exactly how and when we'd be volunteering and exactly how and how much we'd be making a difference. I know I did. And, of course, we were wrong for thinking this. No matter how hard we try, we couldn't make a difference that could hold a candle to our expectations. There will always be more trash on the beach. Many of the turtles are still going to die. We drove out to one of the national parks we frequent yesterday and it was closed because of all of the rain. <i>Thailand happens.</i>
</p>
<p>
I came here expecting to be working 24/7 cleaning beaches, rehabilitating turtles, and saving the rainforest in my free time (as well as learning how to build a website), but that wasn't all realistic. Being here and doing what we can and building strong relationships with the community is so much more important and effective. GVI's philosophy is not to go in and fix what we think needs to be fixed but to ask the community how we can help. I've worked on doing this myself over the last week. My job is to do what GVI knows is best, based on what the community knows is best. And that's great because if they let me, I'd work myself to death. I need someone to remind me to step back and relax. Because <i>Thailand happens</i> and there's so much to love and enjoy about that.

<h3>Thursday 28 May 2015: <span id="location">First Beach Clean</span></h3><br>
<p>
This morning I worked on a beach clean inside another national park. In the two hours I was there, I must have picked up hundreds of lighters, hundreds of feet of string, hundreds of bottle caps and cans and SO. MUCH. STYROFOAM. Pardon me while I lecture for a bit, but <b>styrofoam never ever ever EVER decomposes.</b> Ever. I knew this before, but seeing how much of it is washed up on the beach is really sad. The string and bottle caps will eventually, someday a long time from now, break down a little bit, but that styrofoam will keep floating around. I don't like to use umbrella statements, but I'll certainly do my best to never buy things in styrofoam again.It was a gorgeous day and gorgeous beach though. In the afternoon I observed during a lesson at a local school for Burmese refugee children where we teach English through conservation themed classroom lessons. Next week I'll be paired with a staff member to teach a lesson, and I can't wait.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dri3cjj.jpg" class="FloatLeft" width="30%"><br> <!-- lisaTheLeech.jpg -->
<p>
This morning we left early to do a biodiversity survey in Lampi National Park. It stormed all morning but miraculously wasn't while we were hiking. The rain allowed for a hike that was much cooler though: in temperature and in wildlife. Not only did we see tons of cool insects and lizards, but we saw a [something] pit viper and a flying lemur. We wrote down species identification and GPS coordinates for the animals we saw, and this afternoon I learned how to do the data entry with this information. The data will help the national parks keep tabs on species presence and locations and also helps a lot with government environmental policy.
</p>
<p>
Also I got a leech on my hand. I was told to leave it on until it sucked its share of blood and decided to drop off, but after she (I named her Lisa) grew fat for over 45 minutes, I decided to pull her off and cut her up. I guess I can check that off my bucket list. Sorry Lisa.

<h3>Friday 22 - Sunday 24 May 2015: <span id="location">Koh Kho Khao & Bang Niang/Khao Lak</span></h3><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Vc3fV84.jpg" class="FloatRight" width="25%" title="Ferry ride to Koh Kho Khao"> <!-- ferryRide.jpg -->
<p>
This weekend was a long weekend, so after we completed our Friday chores around the GVI Base, we could go off and explore more of Thailand. We definitely took advantage of this time to see the beautiful country around us. Friday afternoon we took a ferry from Ban Nam Khem across the river inlet to the island of Koh Kho Khao. The distance of the ferry ride felt just like crossing the Mississippi River back home to get from Algiers Point to the French Quarter, but the ferry itself couldn't have been more different. Their ferries are brightly colored wooden boats that sit very low in the water and are propelled by a relatively miniscule motor attached to a long metal rod that the driver can put in and out of the water to steer.
</p>
<p>
During the busy season, Koh Kho Khao is one of the quieter islands that European tourists visit to relax away from the busier cities in Thailand. So in off season, it was totally dead. Which was great. We had a massive stretch of gorgeous beach to ourselves. And best of all (in my opinion) there were four adorable dogs on the beach that kept me entertained. I think they were a little bored with the tourist season being over too.

<p>
Saturday morning we rode a songthaew to a town about an hour away called Bang Niang. The twelve of us from our group went as well as eight other volunteers from around the world also working with GVI currently. I've honestly had so much fun meeting and learning from the other volunteers with such different persepectives and backgrounds. Also they say things funny, which I really enjoy. We enjoyed the weekend here going to the beach, eating more delicious Thai food, and going to the Market where we had more food and haggled for cheap Thai clothes. I bought a (100% cheap counterfeit) Thai soccer jersey that I can't wait to wear the next time I play soccer with the local kids.

<h3>Thursday 21 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>
<p>
Today was a more relaxed day. We started the day with a very early morning bird walk to practice identifying birds using field guides and binoculars. We also had a tour of Ban Nam Khem, though I realized I'd already explored the whole place on the three runs I've gone on so far. It seems like a big town when you're walking around lost, but it really is a tiny village. I went for another run this afternoon and it was only 2 miles to do a full loop around&mdash;this loop takes me by the Pier and beach where the beautiful fishing boats and ferries dock, it takes me past almost a dozen street-food vendors, it takes me through various neighborhoods, including the Burmese areas where the women and children  wipe a powdery white cream on their faces (a symbol of inner beauty in Burmese culture).

<p>
I was planning to keep running a little farther when I passed by the Tsunami Memorial where the boys play soccer. They recognized me from our soccer game a few days ago and called out to me asking for me to join. I started to motion that I was busy running but quickly changed my mind. I can run any time. Playing soccer with these guys makes me really wish my memory was more suited to learning languages and remembering names. I have a hard time understanding their names, much less remembering two dozen of them. They couldn't pronounce my name the first time I said it so I immediately switched to something easier to prevent future problems. I told them "Pom chue Chuck!". <i>My name is Chuck!</i> The language barrier is tough, but the energy and enthusiasm is universal. I've never been a big sports person, but all those cliches about sports uniting cultures and stuff, well, they're true. I've definitely made some very real friends out there on the sandy, garbage-strewn soccer field and yet I can hardly understand their names. I've seen a few of the young guys walking around in the village and they'll always get super excited and wave as they make their ways to the school bus.

<p>
We woke up really early this morning and rode another songthaew to the Turtle Center. Our job this morning was to scrub the turtles, apply anti-fungal ointment to any sores on them, and scrub their (very scummy) tanks clean. It was hard work, but we had a blast. The turtles were adorable but surprisingly strong. Carrying the larger turtles was tough because they would flap their heavy strong flippers everywhere. It was really hot outside and in the end we were drenched in sweat and "turtle juice", but as with any baby animal, it was totally worth it because they were so cute. Where else can you see a basket of turtles?
</p>

<p>
We also had the privilege of seeing a monitor lizard, which is a big cool lizard related to the Komodo Dragon (but without venom, don't worry, Mom).

<p>
Because we started the day so early, we had time to shower, have lunch, and relax before 
our afternoon plans. We spent the afternoon taking a cooking lesson from the owner of the small restaurant we eat at most days for only 50 baht&mdash;the equivalent of $1.50. The ingredients were all presented beautifully and then he showed us how to chop, prep, and cook each of our chosen dishes. We wrote down all of the recipes we learned, so hopefully I can get those typed up and possibly up here at some point. Everything he cooks is delicious. I think my favorite today might have been the green curry. Man the food here is great.

<h3>Tuesday 19 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3></br>

<p>
Today we learned about various bird species we'll see on our biodiversity surveys and did other training exercises before we begin our projects tomorrow. We had an awesome lunch at the restaurant a few doors down again&mdash;I ordered the "chef surprise!" and it was so awesome. When we asked the chef what it was called, he just said it just <i>came from his brain</i>. He's giving us a cooking lesson tomorrow afternoon though and we were allowed to request something to learn from the menu. I requested whatever that meal was that came from his brain today.
</p>

<p>
The highlight of my day though was definitely playing soccer with some of the local children. There are two large fishing boats parked right in the middle of the village where they were dropped by the tsunami in 2004, and right beside them are some makeshift soccer goals. Bryce, Reddy, and I decided to go play with them this afternoon. There were about 20 boys ranging from probably 5- to 12 years old and they were definitely better than me. My size helped a bit, and after I accidentally scored the first goal, they thought I was really good&mdash;which is hilarious. They were so excited to high-5 me after every goal or near victory. And boy was that exhausting. Their energy far surpassed ours and pretty soon we decided to go have dinner at the GVI base (which is always awesome).

<h3>Monday 18 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem & Navy Sea Turtle Conservation site</span></h3><br>
<p>
Yesterday I spent some time wandering the village and taking out my camera for a picture every once in a while. The locals are so nice and so excited to smile and "wai" us (a "wai" is a small bow of the head and hands shown as respect for the other). There are a lot of really cute stray dogs and interesting chickens roaming around very different from the breeds we have at home. Last night we all sprawled out on the roof of the building we're in talking and watching for shooting stars.
</p>
<p>
Jack and I got up a little early this morning and went for a run around parts of Ban Nam Khem. As I've always argued, running is one of the best ways to explore any city. Though it was earlier than we'd be awake at home, the village was already alive; the fishermen had probably been out for hours. After our run, we stopped by a small market to buy some fresh fruit for breakfast. A lady was also selling some fried dough treat too that reminded me a lot of a beignet without powdered sugar. Don't tell Cafe du Monde, but I think I liked it better. And for just a couple cents for half a dozenbetter-than-beignets, yah, I'll take a few orders with a side of fresh mango.

<p>
We started the day with several training lessons on animal species we're likely to see on our biodiversity surveys. We had lunch at a restaurant a few minutes away where I got a really awesome thai noodle dish. Lunches here are all only 50 baht which is about $1.50 in America. Dear Sushi Love, yes, $15 for the pad thai I had delivered cost way too much.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, we rode the songthaewto a beach about half an hour away to collect seaweed. We gathered several garbage bags full and brought it to the local Thai Navy base where there are several small pools of baby sea turtles. Next week, we will be helping to clean these tanks and turtles, but today we just fed and took pictures of them. They were so cute and loved nibbling at my GoPro, which made for some awesome footage that I'll upload when I find strong enough wifi. I've taken a lot of great pictures and videos, and I'm working on getting a lot more of them on here  because I know that's what people really want, but for now, bear with me. I haven't had all that much time or wifi. Keep checking in for more.

<h3>Sunday 17 May 2015: <span id="location">First Day in Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>
<p>Yesterday after we landed, we met GVI volunteers at the airport and then took two vans 
back to the GVI base in Ban Nam Khem, about 1.5 hours away. Thai roads are a bit of a free 
for all, but I found the chaos of them kind of beautiful for the same reasons I find 
nature so beautiful&mdash;everyone is rushing about fending for themselves, but everything 
comes together and just works. I don't know. I think it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>
When they took us to the rooms we'd be staying in, I was shocked. We all were. The view 
from our rooms is incredible. There are also stairs to the roof of the building with an even better view. Ban Nam Khem was hit very hard by the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, and the building we're staying in is a giant beautiful building built as an emergency zone, so the roof is very large and several floors off the ground. For us, this means you can look out at the water and the boats and the village and the homes. You can hear chickens clucking and crowing and motorbikes zooming down the road. So far, every person I've met has been extraordinarily friendly and everything I've eaten has been out of this world.

<h3>Saturday 16 May 2015: <span id="location">On the plane between Hong Kong and Phuket</span></h3><br>
<p>
It has been a very long two days of traveling, but I've enjoyed the time to sit, think, 
and read. I also wasn't expecting to find so many good movies offered for free on the planes, so I've been catching up on movies I haven't had time to see over the last few years. Everyone I've met so far has been exceptionally nice. The flight attendants between JFK airport and Vancouver gave us a small celebration in the back airplane cabin for Jackie's birthday (we technically never had May 15<sup>th</sup> because of all of the time changes).
</p> 
<p>
I also really enjoyed talking to Mr. Lester, the man I was sitting next to between Vancouver and Hong Kong. He lives in Vancouver but was visiting family in Hong Kong where he grew up. He couldn't believe I'd been traveling for almost 20 hours before I even made it to Vancouver. We've had some really long flights and layovers.
</p>
<p>
I've been able to read a lot of the web-design and HTML book I brought on the plane. The seat next to me on this plane is empty, so I've had some room to take out both my laptop and HTML book and practice what I've learned. It's going well so far, and I've changed my site from more than black and white text and added some new formatting stuff. We're almost to Phuket now and the landscape below is gorgeous. I wish the guy in the window seat didn't give me weird looks every time I scoot over and try to look out the window.

<h3>Thursday 14 May 2015: <span id="location">New Orleans, pre-departure</span></h3><br>
<p>
As you probably know, this summer, I'll be traveling to Thailand! I'll be staying in the village of Ban Nam Khem in Phang Nga, a province in the southern peninsula of Thailand. We will be doing primarily conservation volunteering through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GVIThailandPhangNga" target="_blank">GVI</a>. This will entail: 
	<ul> 
		<li>performing biodiversity surveys in local national parks,</li> 
		<li>helping with baby sea turtles,</li>			
		<li>and teaching Burmese refugee children in schools.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Another goal of mine this summer is to learn how to build a website. The last few days, I've been working on getting this site up and running. It's not pretty, and it probably won't be pretty for a long time, but I'll learn. If you want, you can keep an eye on the blog to see pictures and blog posts I'll try to add on a regular basis; you can also hopefully watch my progress with designing the website as it becomes more than simple text and links. But for now, here it is. Enjoy!
