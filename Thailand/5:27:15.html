<h3>Thursday 14 May 2015: <span id="location">New Orleans, pre-departure</span></h3><br>
<p>As you probably know, this summer, I'll be traveling to Thailand! I'll be staying in
the village of Ban Nam Khem in Phang Nga, a province in the southern peninsula of Thailand.
We will be doing primarily conservation volunteering through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GVIThailandPhangNga" target="_blank">GVI</a>. 
This will entail: 
</p><ul> 
	<li>performing biodiversity surveys in local national parks,</li> 
	<li>helping with baby sea turtles,</li>
	<li>and teaching Burmese refugee children in schools.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Another goal of mine this summer is to learn how to build a website. The last few days, I've 
been working on getting this site up and running. It's not pretty, and it probably won't 
be pretty for a long time, but I'll learn. If you want, you can keep an eye on the blog 
to see pictures and blog posts I'll try to add on a regular basis; you can also hopefully 
watch my progress with designing the website as it becomes more than simple text and links. 
But for now, here it is. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Saturday 16 May 2015: <span id="location">On the plane between Hong Kong and Phuket</span></h3><br>
<p>It has been a very long two days of traveling, but I've enjoyed the time to sit, think, 
and read. I also wasn't expecting to find so many good movies offered for free on the planes, 
so I've been catching up on movies I haven't had time to see over the last few years. Everyone 
I've met so far has been exceptionally nice. The flight attendants between JFK airport and Vancouver 
gave us a small celebration in the back airplane cabin for Jackie's birthday (we technically never 
had May 15<sup>th</sup> because of all of the time changes).</p> 
<p>I also really enjoyed talking to Mr. Lester, the man I was sitting next to between 
Vancouver and Hong Kong. He lives in Vancouver but was visiting family in Hong Kong 
where he grew up. He couldn't believe I'd been traveling for almost 20 hours before I even 
made it to Vancouver. We've had some really long flights and layovers.</p>
<p>I've been able to read a lot of the web-design and HTML book I brought on the plane. 
The seat next to me on this plane is empty, so I've had some room to take out both my laptop 
and HTML book and practice what I've learned. It's going well so far, and I've changed my 
site from more than black and white text and added some new formatting stuff. We're almost 
to Phuket now and the landscape below is gorgeous. I wish the guy in the window seat didn't 
give me weird looks every time I scoot over and try to look out the window.</p>

<h3>Sunday 17 May 2015: <span id="location">First Day in Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>
<p>Yesterday after we landed, we met GVI volunteers at the airport and then took two vans 
back to the GVI base in Ban Nam Khem, about 1.5 hours away. Thai roads are a bit of a free 
for all, but I found the chaos of them kind of beautiful for the same reasons I find 
nature so beautiful—everyone is rushing about fending for themselves, but everything 
comes together and just works. I don't know. I think it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>When they took us to the rooms we'd be staying in, I was shocked. We all were. The view 
from our rooms is incredible. There are also stairs to the roof of the building with an even 
better view. Ban Nam Khem was hit very hard by the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, and the building 
we're staying in is a giant beautiful building built as an emergency zone, so the roof is very large and several floors 
off the ground. For us, this means you can look out at the water and the boats and the village 
and the homes. You can hear chickens clucking and crowing and motorbikes zooming down the road. 
So far, every person I've met has been extraordinarily friendly and everything I've eaten 
has been out of this world.</p>

<h3>Monday 18 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem &amp; Navy Sea Turtle Conservation site</span></h3><br>

<p>Yesterday I spent some time wandering the village and taking out my camera for a picture 
every once in a while. The locals are so nice and so excited to smile and "wai" us (a "wai" 
is a small bow of the head and hands shown as respect for the other). There are a lot of really 
cute stray dogs and interesting chickens roaming around very different from the breeds 
we have at home. Last night we all sprawled out on the roof of the building we're in talking and 
watching for shooting stars.</p>

<p>Jack and I got up a little early this morning and went for a run around parts of Ban Nam Khem. 
As I've always argued, running is one of the best ways to explore any city. Though it was earlier 
than we'd be awake at home, the village was already alive; the fishermen had probably been 
out for hours. After our run, 
we stopped by a small market to buy some fresh fruit for breakfast. A lady was also selling 
some fried dough treat too that reminded me a lot of a beignet without powdered sugar. Don't 
tell Cafe du Monde, but I think I liked it better. And for just a couple cents for half a dozen 
better-than-beignets, yah, I'll take a few orders with a side of fresh mango.</p>

<img src="./Addison's DukeEngage_ Thailand Blog_files/birdComplexes.jpg" width="60%" height="60%">

<p>We started the day with several training lessons on animal species we're likely to see 
on our biodiversity surveys. We had lunch at a restaurant a few minutes away where I got 
a really awesome thai noodle dish. Lunches here are all only 50 baht which is about $1.50 in 
America. Dear Sushi Love, yes, $15 for the pad thai I had delivered cost way too much.</p>

<p>After lunch, we rode the songthaew
to a beach about half an hour away to collect seaweed. We gathered several garbage bags full 
and brought it to the local Thai Navy base where there are several small pools of baby sea turtles. 
Next week, we will be helping to clean these tanks and turtles, but today we just fed and took
pictures of them. They were so cute and loved nibbling at my GoPro, which made for some awesome 
footage that I'll upload when I find strong enough wifi. I've taken a lot of great pictures and videos, 
and I'm working on getting a lot more of them on here  because I know that's what people really want, 
but for now, bear with me. I haven't had all that much time or wifi. Keep checking in for more.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 19 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>

<p>Today we learned about various bird species we'll see on our biodiversity surveys and did 
other training exercises before we begin our projects tomorrow. We had an awesome lunch at 
the restaurant a few doors down again—I ordered the "chef surprise!" and it was so awesome. 
When we asked the chef what it was called, he just said it just <i>came from his brain</i>. 
He's giving us a cooking lesson tomorrow afternoon though and we were allowed to request something 
to learn from the menu. I requested whatever that meal was that came from his brain today.</p>

<img src="./Addison's DukeEngage_ Thailand Blog_files/memorialField.jpg" class="FloatLeft" width="30%" height="30%">

<p>The highlight of my day though was definitely playing soccer with some of the local children. 
There are two large fishing boats parked right in the middle of the village where they were 
dropped by the tsunami in 2004, and right beside them are some makeshift soccer goals. 
Bryce, Reddy, and I decided to go play with them this afternoon. There were about 20 boys 
ranging from probably 5- to 12 years old and they were definitely better than me. My size helped 
a bit, and after I accidentally scored the first goal, they thought I was really good—which is 
hilarious. They were so excited to high-5 me after every goal or near victory. And boy was that 
exhausting. Their energy far surpassed pirs and pretty soon we decided to go have dinner at the 
GVI base (which is always awesome).</p>

<img src="./Addison's DukeEngage_ Thailand Blog_files/turtlesBasket.jpg" class="FloatRight" width="20%">

<p>We woke up really early this morning and rode another songthaew to the Turtle Center. Our job 
this morning was to scrub the turtles, apply anti-fungal ointment to any sores on them, and 
scrub their (very scummy) tanks clean. It was hard work, but we had a blast. The turtles were 
adorable but surprisingly strong. Carrying the larger turtles was tough because they would 
flap their heavy strong flippers everywhere. It was really hot outside and in the end we were 
drenched in sweat and "turtle juice", but as with any baby animal, it was totally worth it 
because they were so cute. Where else can you see a basket of turtles?</p>

<p>We also had the privilege of seeing a monitor lizard, which is a big cool lizard related 
to the Komodo Dragon (but without venom, don't worry, Mom).</p><br style="clear: both;">

<p>Because we started the day so early, we had time to shower, have lunch, and relax before 
our afternoon plans. We spent the afternoon taking a cooking lesson from the owner of the small 
restaurant we eat at most days for only 50 baht—the equivalent of $1.50. The ingredients 
were all presented beautifully and then he showed us how to chop, prep, and cook each of our chosen dishes. 
We wrote down all of the recipes we learned, so hopefully I can get those typed up and possibly 
up here at some point. Everything he cooks is delicious. I think my favorite today might have been 
the green curry. Man the food here is great.</p><br style="clear: both;"><p></p>

<h3>Thursday 21 May 2015: <span id="location">Ban Nam Khem</span></h3><br>

<p>Today was a more relaxed day. We started the day with a very early morning bird walk to practice 
identifying birds using field guides and binoculars. We also had a tour of Ban Nam Khem, though 
I realized I'd already explored the whole place on the three runs I'd gone on so far. It seems 
like a big town when you're walking around lost, but it really is a tiny village. I went for another run 
this afternoon and it was only 2 miles to do a full loop around—this loop takes me by the Pier and beach
where the beautiful fishing boats and ferries dock, it takes me past almost a dozen street-food vendors, it takes 
me through various neighborhoods, including the Burmese areas where the women and children  
wipe a powdery white cream on their faces (a symbol of inner beauty in Burmese culture).</p>

<br><br>

<p>I was planning to keep running a little farther when I passed by the Tsunami Memorial where 
the boys play soccer. They recognized me from our soccer game a few days ago and called out to me 
asking for me to join. I started to motion that I was busy running but quickly changed my mind. I can 
run any time. Playing soccer with these guys makes me really wish my memory was more suited to learning 
languages and remembering names. I have a hard time understanding their names, much less remembering 
two dozen of them. They couldn't pronounce my name the first time I said it so I immediately switched to 
something easier to prevent future problems. I told them "Pom chue Chuck!". <i>My name is Chuck!</i> 
The language barrier is tough, but the energy and enthusiasm is universal. I've never been a big 
sports person, but all those cliches about sports uniting cultures and stuff, well, they're true. 
I've definitely made some very real friends out there on the sandy, garbage-strewn soccer field and yet 
I can hardly understand their names. I've seen a few of the young guys walking around in the village 
and they'll always get super excited and wave as they make their ways to the school bus.</p>

<h3>Friday 22 - Sunday 24 May 2015: <span id="location">Koh Kho Khao &amp; Banyang/Khao Lak</span></h3><br>

<img src="./Addison's DukeEngage_ Thailand Blog_files/ferryGroupPic.jpg" class="FloatRight" width="20%">

<p>
This weekend was a long weekend, so after we completed our Friday chores around the GVI Base, we could 
go off and explore more of Thailand. We definitely took advantage of this time to see the beautiful country 
around us. Friday afternoon we took a ferry from Ban Nam Khem across the river inlet to the island of Koh Kho Khao. 
The distance of the ferry ride felt just like crossing the Mississippi River back home to get from Algiers Point 
to the French Quarter, but the ferry itself couldn't have been more different. Their ferries are brightly 
colored wooden boats that sit very low in the water and are propelled by a relatively miniscule motor 
attached to a long metal rod that the driver can put in and out of the water to steer.
</p>
<p>
During the busy season, Koh Kho Khao is one of the quieter islands that European tourists visit 
to relax away from the busier cities in Thailand. So in off season, it was totally dead. Which was 
great. We had a massive stretch of gorgeous beach to ourselves. And best of all (in my opinion) there 
were four adorable dogs on the beach that kept me entertained. I think they were a little bored with 
the tourist season being over too.
</p>

<br>
<p>
Saturday morning we rode a songthaew to a town about an hour away called Banyang. The twelve of us 
from our group went as well as eight other volunteers from around the world also working with GVI 
currently. I've honestly had so much fun meeting and learning from the other volunteers with such 
different persepectives and backgrounds. Also they say things funny, which I really enjoy. We enjoyed 
the weekend here going to the beach, eating more delicious Thai food, and going to the Market where we 
had more food and haggled for cheap Thai clothes. I bought a (100% cheap counterfeit) Thai soccer jersey 
that I can't wait to wear the next time I play soccer with the local kids.

<h3>Monday 25 May 2015: <span id="location">Lampi National Park</span></h3><br>

<img src="./Addison's DukeEngage_ Thailand Blog_files/lisaTheLeech.jpg" class="FloatLeft" width="30%"><br>

<p>
This morning we left early to do a biodiversity survey in Lampi National Park. It stormed all morning 
but miraculously wasn't while we were hiking. The rain allowed for a hike that was much cooler though: 
in temperature and in wildlife. Not only did we see tons of cool insects and lizards, but we saw a 
[something] pit viper and a flying lemur. We wrote down species identification and GPS coordinates 
for the animals we saw, and this afternoon I learned how to do the data entry with this information. 
The data will help the national parks keep tabs on species presence and locations and also helps a lot with 
government environmental policy.
</p>
<p>
Also I got a leech on my hand. I was told to leave it on until it sucked its share of blood and decided
to drop off, but after she (I named her Lisa) grew fat for over 45 minutes, I decided to pull her 
off and cut her up. I guess I can check that off my bucket list. Sorry Lisa.

<div class="BlogPost">
<h3>Thailand Happens - <span id="location">Wednesday 27 May 2015</span></h3><br>
<p>The first thing you hear from veteran volunteers and the first thing you learn for yourself first 
hand when you get here is the common adage <i>"Thailand happens!"</i>. We saw this literally the first hour 
we were here after landing—as we waited for almost an hour for the drivers who'd be taking 
us to Ban Nam Khem to finish driving around the airport and come pick us up. Then racing down 
the two lane road as our van wove around hundreds of motorcycles and motorcycle-sidecar-restaurants 
on its way to the Base. Then at dinner that night when the first meal came out an hour and a half before mine.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i>. It runs on its own time. Drivers show up when they can and dinner comes out when it's 
ready. Big or small, restaurants typically have only one or two wok stoves, so if you're going to wait 
to eat once everyone has been served, only one of you is going to have a hot meal. Don't expect me to wait though, 
we follow different rules here, and I'll eat when the food is hot. (And you know I'll clean my plate!)
</p>
<p>
It's somewhat liberating having different rules though: wake up early, get breakfast from a street vendor who'd 
never pass an inspection at home, ride in the back of a makeshift truck-bed taxi (called a songthaew); 
pick up sea turtles with your bare hands, scrub them with a toothbrush, dirty your clothes but re-wear them 
for a week; use wifi when you have it, eat dinner when it's ready, go to sleep when it's dark. 
Life in Thailand is tougher maybe, but it's simpler and it makes you tougher too. Breaking your 
rules and following new ones makes you question why you do what you do.
</p>
<p><i>
Why do we stay up so late and sleep so early wasting so many hours of daylight?<br>
Why is it so important that we all eat at the same time?<br>
Why does everyone need to drive their own big vehicle everywhere?
</i></p>
<p>
<i>Thailand happens</i> when we're volunteering too. I think a lot of us came in with an idea of exactly 
how and when we'd be volunteering and exactly how and how much we'd be making a difference. I know I did. 
And, of course, we were wrong for thinking this. No matter how hard we try, we couldn't make a difference that 
could hold a candle to our expectations. There will always be more trash on the beach. Many of the turtles 
are still going to die. We drove out to one of the national parks we frequent yesterday and it was closed because 
of all of the rain. <i>Thailand happens.</i>
</p>
<p>
I came here expecting to be working 24/7 cleaning beaches, rehabilitating turtles, and saving the rainforest 
in my free time (as well as learning how to build a website), but that wasn't all realistic. Being here 
and doing what we can and building strong relationships with the community is so much more important 
and effective. GVI's philosophy is not to go in and fix what we think needs to be fixed but to ask the community 
how we can help. I've worked on doing this myself over the last week. My job is to do what GVI knows is best, 
based on what the community knows is best. And that's great because if they let me, I'd work myself to death. 
I need someone to remind me to step back and relax. Because <i>Thailand happens</i> and there's so much 
to love and enjoy about that.
