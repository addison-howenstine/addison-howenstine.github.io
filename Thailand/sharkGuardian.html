<h1>Donate to Shark Guardian</h1>

<h2>What you need to know:</h2>
<p>
<b>Summary</b><br>
Sharks are disappearing from our oceans at an alarming rate, with some records indicating that 90% 
of some of the larger species are already gone. The people of Khao Lak and surrounds are heavily 
dependent on dive-based tourism and fishing. The rapid decline in coral reef health is threatening 
their way of life. Marine-based research and education are essential for the future of this area, 
to ensure that the spectacular coral reefs of Thailand stay healthy.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the issue, problem, or challenge?</b><br>
Recent estimates show as many as 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark products such 
as shark fin soup, teeth and shark oil are popular in much of Asia. With Shark fishing and finning 
largely unregulated, there's been a sharp decline in shark species globally. As apex predators, sharks 
are integral to a healthy marine ecosystem. Coastal Thailand relies heavily on wildlife-based tourism 
and fishing and the current decline in reef health threatens the way of life for thousands of people.
</p>
<p>
<b>How will this project solve this problem?</b><br>
GVI Thailand, in partnerships with Shark Guardian, will provide educational programs/presentations 
to educate people about shark conservation. Research projects, such as citizen science initiatives 
and identification courses will increase scientific understanding of shark populations. Finally, 
we hope to collaborate with other marine organisations to increase our scope and to design and 
implement guidelines/codes of conduct to reduce damaging tourist operations and the demand for shark products.
</p>
<p>
<b>Potential Long Term Impact</b><br>
By educating the local community, we are motivating and inspiring others to get more involved 
with shark and marine conservation activities. Educating the community on sustainable alternatives 
in eco-tourism is the long-term goal in protecting sharks and other marine life. By educating people 
and overcoming previous misconceptions related to these animals, we would hopefully reduce the demand 
of shark products. By promoting promoting eco-tourism we can offer alternative ways of earning money.

<h2>To donate:</h2>
<p>
Go to our <a href="http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/support-shark-conservation-in-thailand/">Global Giving</a> 
page where you can make a tax deductible donation. Also, we're split up into 
teams for a scavenger hunt for this... and we kind of get a head start if our team fund-raises the most... 
and that's not what this is about for me... but if you donate, if you could leave a comment saying that I sent you there... 
it would help my team... <i>and the sharks of course!</i> Thanks so much for any way you can help though.
